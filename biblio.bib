Determining if and how the multivariate genetic variance evolves has been limited by a number of analytical challenges in comparing G-matrices. 

Current methods for the comparison of G typically share several drawbacks: metrics that lack a direct relationship to evolutionary theory, the inability to be applied in conjunction with complex experimental designs, difficulties with determining statistical confidence in inferred differences and an inherently pair-wise focus. 

Here, we present a cohesive and general analytical framework for the comparative analysis of G that addresses these issues, and that incorporates and extends current methods with a strong geometrical basis. We describe the application of random skewers, common subspace analysis, the 4th-order genetic covariance tensor and the decomposition of the multivariate breeders equation, all within a Bayesian framework.

Joanna comment: 

Although determination of the genetic details underpinning G is an active research area (Kelly, 2009), the general lack of information on the distribution of allelic effects and frequencies currently makes it impossible for theoretical quantitative genetic models to clearly predict the evolutionary dynamics of G. Several studies have circumvented this problem through simulation-based approaches, exploring the impact of variation in parameters describing evolutionary processes (selection, mutation and migration) on the evolution of G (Jones et al., 2003; 2004; Guillaume and Whitlock, 2007; Jones et al., 2007; Revell, 2007).},

complex organisms adapt more slowly than simple ones when using mutations of the same phenotypic size. 

Organisms pay a kind of cost of complexity, but magnitude of this cost is considerably larger than Fisher's analysis suggested. 

Indeed the rate of adaptation declines at least as fast as n-1, where n is the number of independent characters or dimensions comprising an organism. The present results also suggest that one can define an effective number of dimensions characterizing an adapting species.

Note: there is no QG here but still might be useful for discussion of slower adaptation due to increased number of traits, might be worth connecting to D&F formula with v(nU,s,N)/n.},

The stability and evolution of this matrix are important issues because they affect our ability to predict how the phenotypic traits evolve by selection and drift. Despite the centrality of these issues, comparative, experimental, and analytical approaches to understanding the stability and evolution of the G-matrix have met with limited success. Nevertheless, empirical studies often find that certain structural features of the matrix are remarkably constant, suggesting that persistent selection regimes or other factors promote stability. On the theoretical side, no one has been able to derive equations that would relate stability of the G-matrix to selection regimes, population size, migration, or to the details of genetic architecture. Recent simulation studies of evolving G-matrices offer solutions to some of these problems, as well as a deeper, synthetic understanding of both the G-matrix and adaptive radiations.},

G AND M IN DYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM
Representing G as an ellipse, selection reduces its size and possibly alters its orientation and shape. Biggest effects seen along directions on AL with greatest curvature. Drift results in on average reduction in size without changing the shape or orientation of G. Mutation counteracts the reducing/torquing effects of selection and drift. The M matrix is also representable by an ellipse, and it may be out of alignment with AL. M can be visualized as sample from a cloud of pleiotropic values for a particular locus. This would lead to pulsating and wobbling of G in equilibrium. Three time scales: short time scale and intermediate time scale, M is roughly constant, while on longer time scale M evolves as well. Evolution of G: fluctuates on short time scale, equilibrates towards compromise between M and AL, and evolves with M and AL over long evolutionary time scales.

Simpson (1944,1953) offered a conceptual bridge between microevolutionary processes (selection, drift, inheritance), and macroevolutionary patterns: best visualization for integrating major issues and themes in phenotypic evolution (p.9). Simpson's 1944 paper synthesized gentical and paleontological approaches to evolution using "ADAPTIVE LANDSCAPE" (phenotype to genotype map) (Q: Fitness is a phenotype right?)

KEYWORDS: Adaptive Landscape, 
-Establish that AL with QG can serve as micro to macro evolutionary bridge.

INTRODCUTION
Problems exist with neo-darwinian theory, i.e. connection between micro- and macroevolution. 

"microevolution:" processes that lead to phenotypic diversificaiton among arrays of conspecific geographic races or closely related species.
"macroevolution:" processes responsible for divergence among genera or higher taxa.

Arnold et al believe that neo-darwinian evolution can account for micro and macroevolution (Lande,1980a; Charlesworth, Lande & Slatkin, 1982). Problems with this view are that micro evolutionary processes cannot be logically extrapolated to explain macro patterns, and that there are any pattern producing processes operating above level of populations. Simpson gave a conceptual bridge for this; his adaptive landscape (AL). Many othe landscapes: Wrightian landscape (gene freq.), landscape for phenotypic plasticity, epigenetic landscape, etc.

COMMENTS:
Neet to check our 
"the theory of G-matrix evolution"
-need to understand the genetic underpinnings of the multivariate phenotype
-evolutionary dynamics of the G-matrix are not well understood
-G-matrix stability depends on lots of factors: number of loci affecting traits, distribution of allelic effects, number of alleles per locus
-existing models cannot guarantee stability of G, but problem is so complex that existing models cannot describe dynamics of G over relevant evolutionary time.

-Barton Turelli 1987, Turelli 1988 - G-matrix stability (i.e. trait covariances over time)

USE IN PAPER
I use this paper as a source for the "rich set of ideas" emerging from the development of multivariate selection. The key idea from this paper concerns adaptive radiations and how that connects with the AL and G matrix QG stuff. Check out the source Schluter 2000 chapter 9 for a discussion of this.},

Arnold and Phillips stated that the constancy of \G in phylogenetic time was an important issue in evolutionary biology (1999), since it would allow us to measure past selection according to \cite{lande1979quantitative}. ``Retrospective selection analysis'' bridges the fields of quantitative genetics and systematics. Other believe that RSA is not possible because \G can fluctuate from generation to generation \cite{Turelli1988}, but it is still unclear (1999) whether \G fluctuates only minor amounts or significantly.},

  Abstract                 = {Divergence in a set of area traits describing morphological form of the mandible in rats and mice was examined by finite element scaling analysis (FESA) and conventional statistical analyses. The area traits correspond to the skeletal derivatives of mesenchymal condensations involved in the production of the rodent mandible. Three major questions are addressed. (1) Can differences in the form of the adult rodent mandible be explained by changes in specific morphogenetic components?F To answer this question, four specific hypotheses that might account for differences between mice and rats in morphological form of the mandible were evaluated: isometric size-scaling, mesenchymal condensation differentiation, muscle hypertrophy, and differential tooth growth. The results support all hypotheses except differential tooth growth, suggesting a complex and multidimensional differentiation in mandibular form between these taxa. The FESA and statistical analyses give qualitatively the same results for all of the hypotheses tested. (2) Has morphological change in mandible form been accompanied by significant changes in the genetic correlation structure?F Genetic correlation patterns among traits are different between these species, and these differences persist after the genetic correlation between mandible dimensions and body weight is accounted for. This result differs from those of previous reports on pelvic dimensions in these animals, where no significant change in genetic correlation structures was found, suggesting mosaic evolution of the skeletal system in these taxa. (3) Does using different extrinsic and intrinsic covariates to scale animals to the same size produce equivalent effects on the covariance structure of the traits?F Results show that different extrinsic and intrinsic covariates in analysis of covariance often produce very different results.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantitative genetics has been introduced to evolutionary biologists with the suggestion that microevolution could be directly linked to macroevolutionary patterns using, among other parameters, the additive genetic variance/covariance matrix (G) which is a statistical representation of genetic constraints to evolution. However, little is known concerning the rate and pattern of evolution of G in nature, and it is uncertain whether the constraining effect of G is important over evolutionary time scales. To address these issues, seven species of field crickets from the genera Gryllus and Teleogryllus were reared in the laboratory, and quantitative genetic parameters for morphological traits were estimated from each of them using a nested full-sibling family design. We used three statistical approaches (T method, Flury hierarchy, and Mantel test) to compare G matrices or genetic correlation matrices in a phylogenetic framework.

The constraint hypothesis was tested by comparing the multivariate orientation of the reconstructed ancestral G matrix to the orientation of the across-species divergence matrix (D matrix, based on mean trait values). The D matrix mainly revealed divergence in size and, to a much smaller extent, in a shape component related to the ovipositor length.

A simulation study is performed to test the validity of various analytical predictions on the equilibrium genetic variance. A new formula for the expected equilibrium variance is derived that approximates the observed equilibrium variance very closely for all parameter combinations we have tested. The computer model simulates the continuum-of-alleles model of Crow and Kimura. However, it is completely stochastic in the sense that it models evolution as a Markov process and does not use any deterministic evolution equations. The theoretical results are compared with heritability estimates from laboratory and natural populations. Heritabilities ranging from 20% to 50%, as observed even in lab populations under a constant environment, can only be explained by a mutation-selection balance if the phenotypic character is neutral or the number of genes contributing to the trait is sufficiently high, typically several hundred, or if there are a few highly variable loci that influence quantitative traits.},

  Abstract                 = {Pleiotropic effects among quantitative characters are believed to be extensive and universal, although their actual amount and pattern remains to be determined. Theoretical studies have shown that pleiotropic effects can influence the dynamics of a character under stabilizing selection and mutation through genetic correlations as well as hidden pleiotropic effects. It is further known that pleiotropic effects on fitness can cause an apparent stabilizing selection for an otherwise neutral character. The response to directional selection also depends on genetic correlations to other characters via correlated selection responses and deleterious side effects. In this paper we analyze a class of models for the adaptation of complex organisms based on three assumptions: (1) pleiotropic effects among characters are extensive, even in the absence of genetic correlations (hidden pleiotropic effects); (2) directional selection only acts on one or a small number of characters simultaneously (mosaic evolution); (3) the remaining characters are either neutral or under stabilizing selection. We show that the response to directed natural selection is strongly influenced by hidden pleiotropic effects on a second uncorrelated character which is under stabilizing selection. The hidden pleiotropic effects are inducing apparent stabilizing selection which interacts with the directional selection acting on the first character. The apparent stabilizing selection is mediated through the dynamics of the genetic variance associated with a change in the mean genotypic value. The result can be either inhibitory or accelerating, depending on the frequency of the alleles. The inhibitory effect can even completely prevent a response to directional selection if apparent stabilizing selection is strong compared to directional selection. In finite populations, the asymptotic rate of evolution is also influenced by hidden pleiotropic effects.

  Abstract                 = {The maintenance of polygenic variability by a balance between mutation and stabilizing selection has been analysed using two approximations: the 'Gaussian' and the 'house of cards'. These lead to qualitatively different relationships between the equilibrium genetic variance and the parameters describing selection and mutation. Here we generalize these approximations to describe the dynamics of genetic means and variances under arbitrary patterns of selection and mutation. We incorporate genetic drift into the same mathematical framework.

The effects of frequency-independent selection and genetic drift can be determined from the gradient of log mean fitness and a covariance matrix that depends on genotype frequencies. These equations describe an 'adaptive landscape', with a natural metric of genetic distance set by the covariance matrix. From this representation we can change coordinates to derive equations describing the dynamics of an additive polygenic character in terms of the moments (means, variances,...) of allelic effects at individual loci. Only under certain simplifying conditions, such as those derived from the Gaussian and house-of-cards approximations, do these general recursions lead to tractable equations for the first few phenotypic moments. The alternative approximations differ in the constraints they impose on the distributions of allelic effects at individual loci. The Gaussian-based prediction that evolution of the phenotypic mean does not change the genetic variance is shown to be a consequence of the assumption that the allelic distributions are never skewed. We present both analytical and numerical results delimiting the parameter values consistent with our approximations.},

  Abstract                 = {A general representation of multilocus selection is extended to allow recombination to depend on genotype. The equations simplify if modifier alleles have small effects on recombination. The evolution of such modifiers only depends on how they alter recombination between the selected loci, and does not involve dominance in modifier effects. The net selection on modifiers can be found explicitly if epistasis is weak relative to recombination. This analysis shows that recombination can be favoured in two ways: because it impedes the response to epistasis which fluctuates in sign, or because it facilitates the response to directional selection. The first mechanism is implausible, because epistasis must change sign over periods of a few generations: faster or slower fluctuations favour reduced recombination. The second mechanism requires weak negative epistasis between favourable alleles, which may either be increasing, or held in check by mutation. The selection (s^ on recombination modifiers depends on the reduction in additive variance of log (fitness) due to linkage disequilibria (vx < 0), and on non-additive variance in log (fitness) (V1', V2', epistasis between 2, 3.. loci). For unlinked loci and pairwise epistasis, j , s_j= -(v1 + 4V2/3)delta_r, where 8r is the average increase in recombination caused by the modifier. The approximations are checked against exact calculations for three loci, and against Charlesworth's analyses of mutation/selection balance (1990), and directional selection (1993). The analysis demonstrates a general relation between selection on recombination and observable components of fitness variation, which is open to experimental test.},

  Abstract                 = {It is widely held that each gene typically affects many characters, and that each character is affected by many genes. Moreover, strong stabilizing selection cannot act on an indefinitely large number of independent traits. This makes it likely that heritable variation in any one trait is maintained as a side effect of polymorphisms which have nothing to do with selection on that trait. This paper examines the idea that variation is maintained as the pleiotropic side effect of either deleterious mutation, or balancing selection. If mutation is responsible, it must produce alleles which are only mildly deleterious (s approximately 10(-3)), but nevertheless have significant effects on the trait. Balancing selection can readily maintain high heritabilities; however, selection must be spread over many weakly selected polymorphisms if large responses to artificial selection are to be possible. In both classes of pleiotropic model, extreme phenotypes are less fit, giving the appearance of stabilizing selection on the trait. However, it is shown that this effect is weak (of the same order as the selection on each gene): the strong stabilizing selection which is often observed is likely to be caused by correlations with a limited number of directly selected traits. Possible experiments for distinguishing the alternatives are discussed.},

COMMENTS:
-basic conflict in observations: ample additive genetic variation and strong stabilizing selection - with explanations: mutation selection balance, selection induces overdominance on loci
-quantitative view of variation being explained character by character leads to conclusion, through naive calculations, that at most 100 characters can be selected upon
-seems more likely that quantitative variation is based on overlapping effects of many genes on many characters

CONCLUSION
-mutation selection balance unlikely cause of quantitative genetic variation

Negative disequilibrium reduces the variance in fitness and hence, by Fisher{\textquoteright}s (1930) fundamental theorem, slows the rate of increase in mean fitness. Modifiers that increase recombination eliminate the negative disequilibria that impede selection and consequently increase in frequency by {\textquotedblleft}hitchhiking.{\textquotedblright} Thus, stochastic fluctuations in linkage disequilibrium in finite populations favor the evolution of increased rates of recombination, even in the absence of epistatic interactions among loci and even when disequilibrium is initially absent. The method developed within this article allows us to quantify the strength of selection acting on a modifier allele that increases recombination in a finite population. The analysis indicates that stochastically generated linkage disequilibria do select for increased recombination, a result that is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations. Selection for a modifier that increases recombination is highest when linkage among loci is tight, when beneficial alleles rise from low to high frequency, and when the population size is small.},

Using our weak-selection approximations, we derive new results concerning the coevolution of male traits and female preferences under natural and sexual selection. In particular, we provide general expressions for the intensity of linkage-disequilibrium induced selection experienced by loci that contribute to female preferences for specific male traits.

Many questions posed by Galton, Weldon, and Pearson remain only partially answered. Weldon (248) asserted that "the problem of animal evolution is essentially a statistical problem," and argued that legitimate conjectures on macroevolution must be based on understanding the factors shaping microevolution: variation, selection, and
heredity. As he not,d, this demands statistical analysis of phenotypic variation (including both variances and correlations), of fitness as a function of phenotype, and of the similarities between parents and offspring. His call, in 1893 , for additional empirical studies of selection in the wild was repeated by Endler in 1986. In his first statistical analyses of multiple characters, Weldon (247, 248) asked whether phenotypic correlations an<t variances from one population were applicable to others. Like Lofsvold (156) and Kohn & Atchley ( 129), he l'ound that correlations were relatively constant, but variances were not. This question of relative constancy of quantitative genetic parameters remains central to evaluations of macroevolutionary analyses that assume constant genetic parameters ( 170, 237).},

In this paper, I present a model in which morphological traits develop hierarchically, and individuals differ in their resource allocation and acquisition patterns. If the variance in resource acquisition is many times larger than the variance in resource allocation then strong genetic correlations are expected, and with almost isometric relations among traits. As the variation in resource acquisition decreases below a certain threshold, the correlations decrease overall and the relations among traits become a function of the allocation patterns, and in particular reflecting the basal division of allocation. A strong bottleneck can break a pattern of strong genetic correlation, but this effect diminishes rapidly with increasing bottleneck size. This model helps to understand why some populations change their genetic correlations in different environments, whereas others do not, since the key factor is the relation between the variances in resource acquisition and allocation. If a change in environment does not lead to a change in this ratio, no change can be expected, whereas if the ratio is changed substantially then major changes can be expected. This model can also help to understand the constancy of morphological patterns within larger taxa as a function of constancy in resource acquisition patterns over time and environments. When this pattern breaks, for example on islands, larger changes can be expected.},

This is more of a review paper that combines the Y-model of van Noordwijk and de Jong with the bifurcation trees for traits/cells in developmental biology to model genetic correlations between traits that can include morphological characters. Overall, the paper focuses on simulations and talks about their results. Some of the main conclusions have to due with the ratio of variance and allocation versus acquisition and their effects on the observed genetic correlations between traits. 

There are two key measures used in the paper: 1) the ratio of lambda_1 over lambda_2 and 2) the angle between eval_1 and the isometry vector (1,.....1). The larger the ratio, the stronger the genetic correlations since the space is basically flattened into one dimension. To measure the strength of correlations, they used the angle between eval_1 and the isometry vector. When correlations were high, the leading eigen vector is almost equal to the isometry vector, but as these correlations are broken apart, the leading eigenvector departs from isometry and the angle between eval_1 and the isometry vector increases.

A basic message from all this is that variance in allocation can basically washout the effects of allocations (functional contraints) causing positive genetic correlations. This is basically summarized in figure 6, where he shows three graphs with different angles (90 degrees = low genetic correlations low ratio of acquisition variance over allocation variance, 0-90 degrees = medium size ratio of acquisition variance to allocation variance, and 0 degrees = high genetic correlations with high ratio of acquisition variance to allocation variance).

Bottlenecks have the effect of increasing the angle between eval_1 and the isometry vector, but the amount depends on the initial variance in acquisition. The higher the variance in acquisition, the less effect the bottleneck has on the angle change, but over all, severe bottlenecks will alter the genetic correlations (see figure 5). 

One important thing to note is that here, the functional constraints again manifest through allocations that give rise to trade-offs between pairs, which is different from the way functional constraints enter charnov and charlesworth's approach using QG or optimization. There should be an equilivalence between them, but that is not explained by charlesworth in his paper. However, it might appear in the prior paper by Arnold (1992). I don't recall seeing it there, but I will check again.

Lastly, Bjorklund uses the results of his work (specifically how ratio of V_alloc / V_acqui affects genetic correlations) to suggest that the mixed results obtained from empirical studies might be due to the underlying differences in allocation.
Interestingly he points out that differences in size correspond to differences in allocation patterns. In some populations (such as in birds), V_alloc << V_acqui, meaning that selection against allocation will still produce mostly size differences (allocation), i.e overall size. The smaller V_alloc, the more rapid the divergence in non size related correlations. He discusses the patterns in Island models and how this might relate.}

KEY RESULTS: G-matrices change rapidly and unpredictably over time. Estimates of G-matrices in a 25 year period in the collard flycatcher show that unpredictability over time, and more importantly, these G-matrices do not predict changes in traits in response to selection.

DATA: A 25-year long individual based field study on nearly 7000 breeding attempts of the collard flycatcher (ficedula albicollis) was. 
 
COMMENTS:
-It seems for this data, G-matrices are unable to explain how traits response to artificial selection. It would be interesting to see if perhaps our model could explain the behavior of the data from this field study. Also, it might be interesting to see if our model obeys the laws of quantitative genetics expressed in the breeder's equation. Can this be outputted as a means to obtain confidence in this framework?
-Six G-matrices were estimated, with differences in pedigree accounted for by ensuring that no relationship between pedigree structure (measure as either mean relatedness, number of individuals, or number of sibs) and estimated evolvability, respondability or conditional evolvability.
-Four traits were measured: tails, tars, wing and mass.
-Their results show that genetic covariances will affect the outcome of selection in all time periods, but in different ways within each.
-Figure three in the paper shows that genetic covariances act more to constrain response to selection.
-Authors suspect effects of indirect selection that complicates the analysis (Bjorklund & Gustafsson >2013).
-Lack of any patterns in expression of genes likely because of time, population and environment (Falconer & MacKay 1989). 
-In all period there is a dimension of G that doesn't respond to selection, but it changes in each time period.
-One major proposition of authors in light of their results is that if G changes quickly in response to selection (or changes in the variation of acquisition of resources), the our ability to predict long term evolutionary change is limited and valid for periods of time where G is stable.
-G-matrices from different time periods were compared using the eigen tensor approach.

The second is the genetic variance-covariance matrix (G) that influences the multivariate response to selection. A common approach to the empirical analysis of these matrices is the element-by-element testing of significance, and subsequent biological interpretation of pattern based on these univariate and bivariate parameters. Here, I show why this approach is likely to misrepresent the genetic basis of quantitative traits, and the selection acting on them in many cases. Diagonalization of square matrices is a fundamental aspect of many of the multivariate statistical techniques used by biologists. Applying this, and other related approaches, to the analysis of the structure of gamma and G matrices, gives greater insight into the form and strength of nonlinear selection, and the availability of genetic variance for multiple traits.},

We review a range of theoretical and empirical results covering single traits to more complex multivariate systems, and show that an absence of genetic variance may be more common than is currently appreciated. From a single-trait perspective, we highlight that it is becoming clear that some trait types do not display significant levels of genetic variation, and we raise the possibility that species with restricted ranges may differ qualitatively from more widespread species in levels of genetic variance in ecologically important traits. A common misconception in many life-history studies is that a lack of genetic variance in single traits, and genetic constraints as a consequence of bivariate genetic correlations, are different causes of selection limits. We detail how interpretations of bivariate patterns are unlikely to demonstrate genetic limits to selection in many cases. We advocate a multivariate definition of genetic constraints that emphasizes the presence (or otherwise) of genetic variance in the multivariate direction of selection. For multitrait systems, recent results using longer term studies of organisms, in which more is understood concerning what traits may be under selection, have indicated that selection may exhaust genetic variance, resulting in a limit to the selection response.},

  Abstract                 = {Environmental heterogeneity is considered a general explanation for phenotypic diversification, particularly when heterogeneity causes populations to diverge via local adaptation. Performance trade-offs, such as those stemming from antagonistic pleiotropy, are thought to contribute to the maintenance of diversity in this scenario. Specifically, alleles that promote adaptation in one environment are expected to promote maladaptation in alternative environments. Contrary to this expectation, however, alleles that underlie locally adaptive traits often fail to exhibit fitness costs in alternative environments. Here, we attempt to explain this paradox by reviewing the results of experimental evolution studies, including a new one of our own, that examined the evolution of trade-offs during adaptation to homogeneous versus heterogeneous environments. We propose that when pleiotropic effects vary, whether or not trade-offs emerge among diverging populations will depend critically on ecology. For example, adaptation to a locally homogeneous environment is more likely to occur by alleles that are antagonistically pleiotropic than adaptation to a locally heterogeneous environment, simply because selection is blind to costs associated with environments that are not experienced locally. Our literature review confirmed the resulting prediction that performance trade-offs were more likely to evolve during selection in homogeneous than heterogeneous environments. The nature of the environmental heterogeneity (spatial versus temporal) and the length of the experiment also contributed in predictable ways to the likelihood that performance trade-offs evolved.},

Both prospective and retrospective studies of phenotypic evolution across generations rely on assumptions about the constancy of patterns of genetic covariance through time. In the absence of robust theoretical predictions about the stability of genetic covariances, this assumption must be tested with empirical comparisons of genetic parameters among populations and species. Genetic variance-covariance matrices were estimated for a suite of antipredator traits in two populations of the northwestern garter snake, Thamnophis ordinoides. The characters studied include color pattern and antipredator behaviors that interact to facilitate escape from predators. Significant heritabilities for all traits were detected in both populations. Genetic correlations and covariances were found among behaviors in both populations and between color pattern and behavior in one of the populations. Phenotypic means differed among populations, but pairwise comparisons revealed no heterogeneity of genetic parameters between the populations.

This result is here extended to allow for the effect of linkage, and it is shown that the change in the variance is effectively determined by the harmonic mean of the recombination fractions. The validity of the approximate general formula derived here has been checked by comparison with exact results obtained from models with five or six loci. In order to determine the likely value of the harmonic mean recombination fraction, a simple model was constructed in which it was assumed that loci are distributed at random along the chromosome maps. Results of computer simulations of this model are reported for different chromosome numbers and numbers of loci.},

  Abstract                 = {If a metric character is determined by an effectively infinite number of loci, selection cannot cause any permanent change in the genetic variance but will cause a temporary change which is rapidly reversed when selection ceases. This change is due entirely to the correlation between pairs of loci which is induced by selection; the correlation is negative, leading to a reduction in the genetic variance under stabilizing or directional selection, and is positive, leading to an increase in the variance under disruptive selection. When selection ceases, the correlation rapidly disappears as joint equilibrium at pairs of loci is reestablished, and the variance returns to its original value. An expression is derived for the predicted amount of change in the genetic variance due to disequilibrium in the absence of linkage. The change is likely to be small under selection intensities found under natural conditions, but it may be appreciable under intense artificial selection. This limiting result shows that the magnitude of any permanent change in the variance due to selection must decrease as the number of loci involved increases and that, when the number of loci is large, it is likely to be much less than the temporary change due to disequilibrium.},

We model a large population subject to mutation, recombination, selection, and drift, assuming a pleiotropic model of mutations sampled from a bivariate distribution of effects of mutations on a quantitative trait and fitness. The pleiotropic model investigated, in contrast to previous models, implies that common mutations of large effect are responsible for most of the genetic variation for quantitative traits, except when the trait is fitness itself. We show that GWAS applied to the full sequence increases the number of QTL detected by as much as 50% compared to the number found with SNP chips but only modestly increases the amount of additive genetic variance explained. Even with full sequence data, the total amount of additive variance explained is generally below 50%. Using RHM on the full sequence data, a slightly larger number of QTL are detected than by GWAS if the same probability threshold is assumed, but these QTL explain a slightly smaller amount of genetic variance. Our results also suggest that most of the missing heritability is due to the inability to detect variants of moderate effect (~0.03-0.3 phenotypic SDs) segregating at substantial frequencies. Very rare variants, which are more difficult to detect by GWAS, are expected to contribute little genetic variation, so their eventual detection is less relevant for resolving the missing heritability problem.},

Data from the literature provide preliminary evidence that artificial selection on dogs (through domestication) generated variations in personality traits that are correlated with life histories and metabolism. We found that obedient (or docile, shy) breeds live longer than disobedient (or bold) ones and that aggressive breeds have higher energy needs than unaggressive ones.

In regions of the genome where recombination is frequent, the effects of selection against deleterious mutations on variability and evolution at linked sites can be predicted under the assumption that most deleterious mutations have such large effects that their behavior in the population is effectively deterministic-this is background selection in the strict sense. But in genomic regions with little or no recombination, such as the Y chromosome, large departures from the predictions using deterministic models may occur, because of interference between different sites under selection. Evidence from Drosophila and human populations is discussed, which suggests that these processes play a major role in shaping patterns of DNA sequence variation and evolution, including the relative levels of variation on X chromosomes and autosomes, and the highly reduced variability seen in regions that lack crossing over.},

General formulae are derived for the expected rates of gene substitution and genetic diversity, relative to the neutral case, as a function of selection and dominance coefficients at the loci in question, and of the frequency of gametes that are free of deleterious mutations with respect to the loci responsible for background selection. As in the neutral case, most effects of background selection can be predicted by considering the effective size of the population to be multiplied by the frequency of mutation-free gametes. Levels of genetic diversity can be sharply reduced by background selection, with the result that values for sites under selection approach those for neutral variants subject to the same regime of background selection. Rates of fixation of slightly deleterious mutations are increased by background selection, and rates of fixation of advantageous mutations are reduced. The properties of sex-linked and autosomal asexual and self-fertilizing populations are considered.

Although large negative genetic correlations are to be expected between some pairs of life-history traits in populations at equilibrium under selection, in general some small negative genetic correlations and some positive genetic correlations will also be present. Thus, the observation of a positive genetic correlation between a pair of life-history traits does not necessarily refute the possibility of trade-offs among a multivariate set of traits that contains the pair in question. The relation between the pattern of functional constraints and the genetic correlations is often complex, and little insight into the former can be derived from the latter. The effects of mutations that lower the overall efficiency of resource utilization, thereby creating a positive component to the genetic covariances among life-history traits, are also considered for a specific model. Although such mutations can have a substantial effect on the form of the life history, extreme conditions seem to be needed for them to produce a large effect on the pattern of genetic correlations in a random-mating population. They can, however, cause the appearance of positive correlations following inbreeding, due to the exposure of deleterious recessive or partially recessive mutations. The analysis also suggests that the population means of individual components of a constrained multivariate system may often equilibrate at values that are far from the optima that would be attained if they were selected in isolation from the other members of the system.},

There are a couple of major conclusions in the paper. The first has to do with showing the equivalency of optimization and quantitative genetics for solutions to genetic correlations that emerge. It requires assumptions of weak selection, small variances and covariances in traits, depending on the nonlinearity of constraint relationships. This is true when the optimum has not been reached in the trait space, indicating that G must be singular and thus the functional constraints impose relationships between the components of G.

Next, they showed that at equilibrium, some genetic correlations will be negative, but positive ones will also occur. There is only an indirect relationship between G and functional constraints. It cannot be easily determined or solved for.

Mutations come in two forms, and their effect cause different equilibrium values of G. The first case is given when mutations obey the constraint functions, and thus the pressure they cause perturb the equilibrum values of G and mean fitness \bar{w}. The other case is that the mutations induces genetic correlations that do not obey the functional constraints. In this second case, mutations alter G al la Lande (1980).}

  Abstract                 = {Selection against deleterious alleles maintained by mutation may cause a reduction in the amount of genetic variability at linked neutral sites. This is because a new neutral variant can only remain in a large population for a long period of time if it is maintained in gametes that are free of deleterious alleles, and hence are not destined for rapid elimination from the population by selection. Approximate formulas are derived for the reduction below classical neutral values resulting from such background selection against deleterious mutations, for the mean times to fixation and loss of new mutations, nucleotide site diversity, and number of segregating sites. These formulas apply to random-mating populations with no genetic recombination, and to populations reproducing exclusively asexually or by self-fertilization. For a given selection regime and mating system, the reduction is an exponential function of the total mutation rate to deleterious mutations for the section of the genome involved. Simulations show that the effect decreases rapidly with increasing recombination frequency or rate of outcrossing. The mean time to loss of new neutral mutations and the total number of segregating neutral sites are less sensitive to background selection than the other statistics, unless the population size is of the order of a hundred thousand or more. The stationary distribution of allele frequencies at the neutral sites is correspondingly skewed in favor of rare alleles, compared with the classical neutral result. Observed reductions in molecular variation in low recombination genomic regions of sufficiently large size, for instance in the centromere-proximal regions of Drosophila autosomes or in highly selfing plant populations, may be partly due to background selection against deleterious mutations.},

But when they are common, many beneficial mutations will occur before any can fix, so there will be many different mutant lineages in the population concurrently. In an asexual population, these different mutant lineages interfere and not all can fix simultaneously. In addition, further beneficial mutations can accumulate in mutant lineages while these are still a minority of the population. In this article, we analyze the dynamics of such multiple mutations and the interplay between multiple mutations and interference between clones. These result in substantial variation in fitness accumulating within a single asexual population. The amount of variation is determined by a balance between selection, which destroys variation, and beneficial mutations, which create more. The behavior depends in a subtle way on the population parameters: the population size, the beneficial mutation rate, and the distribution of the fitness increments of the potential beneficial mutations. The mutation-selection balance leads to a continually evolving population with a steady-state fitness variation. This variation increases logarithmically with both population size and mutation rate and sets the rate at which the population accumulates beneficial mutations, which thus also grows only logarithmically with population size and mutation rate. These results imply that mutator phenotypes are less effective in larger asexual populations. They also have consequences for the advantages (or disadvantages) of sex via the Fisher-Muller effect; these are discussed briefly.},

The model considers a large number of linked identical loci, or nucleotide sites; assumes that the selection coefficient per site is much less than the mutation rate per genome; and includes back and compensating mutations. Using analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate the accuracy of our results over almost the entire range of population sizes. Two limiting cases of our results, when either deleterious or advantageous mutations can be neglected, correspond to the Fisher-Muller effect and Muller's ratchet, respectively. By comparing predictions of our model (no recombination) to those of simple single-locus models (strong recombination), we show that the accumulation of advantageous mutations is slowed by linkage over a broad, finite range of population size. This supports the view of Fisher and Muller, who argued in the 1930s that progressive evolution of organisms is slowed because loci at which beneficial mutations can occur are often linked together on the same chromosome. These results follow from our main finding, that distribution of sequences over the mutation number evolves as a traveling wave whose speed and width depend on population size and other parameters. The model explains a logarithmic dependence of steady-state fitness on the population size reported recently for an RNA virus.},

EXPERIMENT:
-examined yeast in glucose limited media evolving for 500 generations at three different effective population sizes (1.4e3, 7e4, 3.5e6)
-two population types: (1) "nonmutator" types and (2) "mutator" types (msh\Delta) with x10 Ub
-1 gen 130 min in selected media
-assay consisted of measuring fitness by sampling population and mixing with ancestral strain (identified with yellow fluorescent protein), growth for 20 generations and determining ratios of two
-total fitness change over 500 gens used to measure average speed of evolution
-fitness distribution also measured for some of the populations by isolating 96 individuals and measuring their individual fitness
-experiment showed no indication that mean fitness of population was slowing down

COMMENTS:
-the authors comment that their "nonmutator" populations increased in fitness by something like 4-7\% in 500 generations, est of v_nonm, and 
-This is not enought time for two mutations adding up to that amount to fix in succession (basically, multiple mutations must be at work)
-
Ub and s are fitted to the data, shown to be Ub = 2.4e-4 and s=2\% for mutators, Ub=2.4e-5 for non mutators, and explaining of how these fits are obtained are briefly mentioned in figure 4
-all growth is in exponential phase, so enironmental factors are not at work which would come into effect at carrying capacity}

Most analyses of these distortions focus on the signatures of hitchhiking due to hard or soft selective sweeps at a single genetic locus. However, in linked regions of rapidly adapting genomes, multiple beneficial mutations at different loci can segregate simultaneously within the population, an effect known as clonal interference. This leads to a subtle interplay between hitchhiking and interference effects, which leads to a unique signature of rapid adaptation on genetic variation both at the selected sites and at linked neutral loci. Here, we introduce an effective coalescent theory (a {\textquotedblleft}fitness-class coalescent{\textquotedblright}) that describes how positive selection at many perfectly linked sites alters the structure of genealogies. We use this theory to calculate several simple statistics describing genetic variation within a rapidly adapting population and to implement efficient backward-time coalescent simulations, which can be used to predict how clonal interference alters the expected patterns of molecular evolution.},

-develops coalescent theories (statistics) for the directional selection in asexual populations evolving in concurrent mutations regime

COMMENTS
-same model setup for concurrent mutations regime in desai and fisher 2007
-the U/s<<1 condition ensures that the stochastic nose rarely produces mutants of any sort, but there is still the question of the bulk and mutational pressures there.
-the examine patterns of genetic variation in a rapidly adapting population (clonal interf. regime) using a fitness class coalescent method
-derivation of equation 10 stems from the use of independence in the \nu_i for B loci indicated in the sum

COMMENTS FOR PAPER
-note that for their analysis of the genetic diversity, they focus strictly on the nose of the distribution, which means for your case, you will have to define what the nose is in this 2d distribution

  Abstract                 = {Pleiotropy, the ability of a single mutant gene to cause multiple mutant phenotypes, is a relatively common but poorly understood phenomenon in biology. Perhaps the greatest challenge in the analysis of pleiotropic genes is determining whether phenotypes associated with a mutation result from the loss of a single function or of multiple functions encoded by the same gene. Here we estimate the degree of pleiotropy in yeast by measuring the phenotypes of 4710 mutants under 21 environmental conditions, finding that it is significantly higher than predicted by chance. We use a biclustering algorithm to group pleiotropic genes by common phenotype profiles. Comparisons of these clusters to biological process classifications, synthetic lethal interactions, and protein complex data support the hypothesis that this method can be used to genetically define cellular functions. Applying these functional classifications to pleiotropic genes, we are able to dissect phenotypes into groups associated with specific gene functions.Mol Syst Biol. 1: 2005.0001},

However, the effects of G on the response to selection might be of less importance than previously thought. In addition, it has been suggested that selection itself, under certain conditions, might rapidly alter the genetic covariance structure. If selection can indeed affect the stability of G to facilitate evolution, the overall structure of G might not be as important to consider as the past selective conditions that G was subject to. Thus, more empirical work is needed on the stability of G in the early stages of divergence before one can really assess to what extent G constrains evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {We tested the ability of six quantitative genetic models to explain the evolution of phenotypic means using an extensive database compiled by Gingerich. Our approach differs from past efforts in that we use explicit models of evolutionary process, with parameters estimated from contemporary populations, to analyze a large sample of divergence data on many different timescales. We show that one quantitative genetic model yields a good fit to data on phenotypic divergence across timescales ranging from a few generations to 10 million generations. The key feature of this model is a fitness optimum that moves within fixed limits. Conversely, a model of neutral evolution, models with a stationary optimum that undergoes Brownian or white noise motion, a model with a moving optimum, and a peak shift model all fail to account for the data on most or all timescales. We discuss our results within the framework of Simpson?s concept of adaptive landscapes and zones. Our analysis suggests that the underlying process causing phenotypic stasis is adaptation to an optimum that moves within an adaptive zone with stable boundaries. We discuss the implication of our results for comparative studies and phylogeny inference based on phenotypic characters.},

Soon after his appointment o ABGRO, WADDINGTON was offered the Buchanan Chair of Animal Genetics in the University of Edinburgh in succession to F. A. E. CREW.

Using approximate multivariate normal distribution methods, it is demonstrated that the condition for selection to result in a specialized phenotype is that the curve of fitness as a function of breeding value be bimodal. This implies that a specialized phenotype is more likely to result the higher is the heritability of the character.

Hill and Robertson found that the average effect of this randomly-generated linkage disequilibrium was to cause linked loci to interfere with each other{\textquoteright}s response to selection, even where there was no gene interaction between the loci. This effect is shown to be identical to the original argument of Fisher and Muller. It also predicts the "ratchet mechanism" discovered by Muller, who pointed out that deleterious mutants would more readily increase in a population without recombination. Computer simulations of substitution of favorable mutants and of the long-term increase of deleterious mutants verified the essential correctness of the original Fisher-Muller argument and the reality of the Muller ratchet mechanism. It is argued that these constitute an intrinsic advantage of recombination capable of accounting for its persistence in the face of selection for tighter linkage between interacting polymorphisms, and possibly capable of accounting for its origin.},

  Abstract                 = {There are two simple caricatures of evolutionary dynamics: the phenotypic caricature focuses on continuous and predictable selection on variability of quantitative traits, whereas the genotypic caricature focuses on discrete, stochastic mutations. Although the apparent contradictions between these pictures were reconciled long ago, our quantitative understanding of the interplay between them is still surprisingly primitive. Indeed, even the simplest models of the dynamics of large asexual populations in which many alleles and many new mutations contribute to the evolving fitness have resisted solution. The PNAS paper by Hallatschek (1) is a substantial advance in the development of the mathematical methods needed to analyze these and more complex models.

What is the source of the basic difficulty? The Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection describes, quantitatively, how a diverse population subject to selective pressure evolves. It states that the rate of change of the average of a quantitative trait is proportional to the hereditable part of the variance of that trait times the strength of selection for it. But what determines the variance of a trait that is under selection? Initially, the frequencies of the various alleles that contribute to it: if there are many of these, the sum of their positive and negative contributions will give rise to a roughly normal bell-shaped distribution of the fitness. However, as selection proceeds, some of the alleles will rise to fixation and others die out. Thus, under steady selection, after a modest time, only the beneficial alleles will remain and there will be no variance at all: the increase in fitness then comes to a grinding halt. But of course there can be new beneficial mutations. If only one such mutation arose at a time, it would sweep through the population before another occurred: this is the simple population genetics caricature of discrete mutation-selection events. ...},

  Abstract                 = {Reproduction shortens lifespan in practically all organisms examined so far, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown to date. Here I review what evolutionary and molecular biologists have learned about such "costs of reproduction" in the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) since Maynard Smith's (1958) seminal discovery that sterile mutants in D. subobscura live substantially longer than fertile wildtype flies. Together with observations from the nematode worm (Caenorhabditis elegans) and other organisms, the data from Drosophila suggest that there are at least four general principles that underlie trade-offs between reproduction and lifespan: (1) trade-offs between survival and reproduction are widespread; (2) the relationship between increased lifespan and decreased fecundity can be uncoupled under certain conditions; (3) while survival costs of reproduction might not necessarily be due to competitive resource allocation, we lack robust alternative explanations for their occurrence; and (4) physiological trade-offs between reproduction and longevity do not always translate into evolutionary genetic trade-offs. I conclude that - despite much recent progress - our current understanding of the proximate basis of survival costs of reproduction remains very limited; much future work on the genetics and physiology of such trade-offs will be required to uncover their mechanistic basis.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the features of organisms that makes the study of biology so compelling is their apparent complexity. Molecular, cellular, developmental, physiological, neurological, and behavioral systems are each fascinating in and of themselves, but it is their interaction that generates what we see as the organism as a whole. By necessity, biologists have a tendency to break down organisms into their component parts to see how they work. Yet, no trait is an island (Dobzhansky 1956). In particular, we need to consider the organism in its entirety when looking at evolutionary change. This perspective is necessitated simply by the fact that it is the whole individual, not specific traits or particular alleles, that lives and dies. The whole individual is therefore the central unit of selection (Lewontin 1970). How can we deal with the complexity inherent in trying to integrate biological function and evolutionary change across the whole organism? Quantitative genetics provides an attractive potential framework because it attempts to summarize important features of the genetic system while focusing firmly at the level of the phenotype. The multiple trait (multivariate) formulations of quantitative genetics that we will discuss here can be seen both as a conceptual framework for integrating multiple systems at many levels and as a tool for making quantitative predictions about evolutionary change. Whether it succeeds on either count is the subject of active debate (Barton and Turelli 1989). Ways of successfully building upon the traditional statistical framework of quantitative genetics is one of the exciting areas of future growth within the field of evolutionary genetics.},

COMMENTS:
-G evolution depends on selection and other forces, see equation in box 3
-Phillips states that we know very little about how G evolves,(bottom of first page), made explicit by equation in box 3 which has other components that cannot easily be estimated
-the implications are that we do not know whether micro- or macroevolution is what molds and changes a G-matrix of a population.
-Divergence in populations is discussed as being understood within this multivariate framework of quantitative genetics. This would definitely be worth following up on.

We study how adaptation affects range shifts when it involves multiple quantitative traits evolving in response to local selection pressures and gene flow. All traits develop clines shifting in space, some of which may be in a direction opposite to univariate predictions, and the species tracks its environmental optimum with a constant lag. We provide analytical expressions for the local density and average trait values. A species can sustain faster environmental shifts, develop a wider range and greater local adaptation when spatial environmental variation is low (generating low migration load) and multitrait adaptive potential is high. These conditions are favoured when nonlinear (stabilising) selection is weak in the phenotypic direction of the change in optimum, and genetic variation is high in the phenotypic direction of the selection gradient.},

However, this metaphor, with its emphasis on adaptive peaks and valleys, is to a large degree a reflection of our three-dimensional experience. Both genotypes and phenotypes of biological organisms differ in numerous characteristics, and, thus, the dimension of real' adaptive landscapes is much larger than three. Properties of multidimensional adaptive landscapes are very different from those of low dimension. Consequently, something that is seen as a theoretical challenge in a low-dimensional case might be a trivial problem in a multidimensional context and vice versa. In particular, the problem of how a population crosses an adaptive valley on its way from one adaptive peak to another, which Wright attempted to solve with his shifting balance theory, may be non-existent. A new framework is emerging for deepening our understanding of evolution and speciation, which provides a plausible multidimensional alternative to the conventional view of rugged adaptive landscapes.},

  Abstract                 = {When large asexual populations adapt, competition between simultaneously segregating mutations slows the rate of adaptation and restricts the set of mutations that eventually fix. This phenomenon of interference arises from competition between mutations of different strengths as well as competition between mutations that arise on different fitness backgrounds. Previous work has explored each of these effects in isolation, but the way they combine to influence the dynamics of adaptation remains largely unknown. Here, we describe a theoretical model to treat both aspects of interference in large populations. We calculate the rate of adaptation and the distribution of fixed mutational effects accumulated by the population. We focus particular attention on the case when the effects of beneficial mutations are exponentially distributed, as well as on a more general class of exponential-like distributions. In both cases, we show that the rate of adaptation and the influence of genetic background on the fixation of new mutants is equivalent to an effective model with a single selection coefficient and rescaled mutation rate, and we explicitly calculate these effective parameters. We find that the effective selection coefficient exactly coincides with the most common fixed mutational effect. This equivalence leads to an intuitive picture of the relative importance of different types of interference effects, which can shift dramatically as a function of the population size, mutation rate, and the underlying distribution of fitness effects.},

G is used to predict the direction of evolutionary change in natural populations. However, this usage requires that G is sufficiently constant over time to have enough predictive significance. Here, we explore the alternative explanation that G can evolve due to gene flow to conform to the direction of divergence between incipient species. We use computer simulations in a mainland-island migration model with stabilizing selection on two quantitative traits. We show that a high level of gene flow from a mainland population is required to significantly affect the orientation of the G-matrix in an island population. The changes caused by the introgression of the mainland alleles into the island population affect all aspects of the shape of G (size, eccentricity, and orientation) and lead to the alignment of gmax with the line of divergence between the two populations' phenotypic optima. Those changes decrease with increased correlation in mutational effects and with a correlated selection. Our results suggest that high migration rates, such as those often seen at the intraspecific level, will substantially affect the shape and orientation of G, whereas low migration (e.g., at the interspecific level) is unlikely to substantially affect the evolution of G.},

This paradox would be resolved if stabilizing selection were common, but stabilizing selection is infrequently detected in natural populations. We hypothesize a simple solution to this apparent disconnect: stabilizing selection is hard to detect empirically once populations have adapted to a fitness peak. To test this hypothesis, we developed an individual-based model of a population evolving under an invariant stabilizing fitness function. Stabilizing selection on the population was infrequently detected in an ``empirical'' sampling protocol, because (1) trait variation was low relative to the fitness peak breadth; (2) nonselective deaths masked selection; (3) populations wandered around the fitness peak; and (4) sample sizes were typically too small. Moreover, the addition of negative frequency-dependent selection further hindered detection by flattening or even dimpling the fitness peak, a phenomenon we term ``squashed stabilizing selection.'' Our model demonstrates that stabilizing selection provides a plausible resolution to the paradox of stasis despite its infrequent detection in nature. The key reason is that selection ``erases its traces'': once populations have adapted to a fitness peak, they are no longer expected to exhibit detectable stabilizing selection. },

Attempts to understand the evolutionary significance of the genetic variance matrix are hampered by the fact that the majority of the methods used to characterize and compare variance matrices have not been derived in an explicit theoretical context. We use the Lande equation to derive new measures of the ability of a variance matrix to allow or constrain evolution in any direction in phenotype space. Evolvability captures the ability of a population to evolve in the direction of selection when stabilizing selection is absent. Conditional evolvability captures the ability of a population to respond to directional selection in the presence of stabilizing selection on other trait combinations. We then derive measures of character autonomy and integration from these evolvabilities. We study the properties of these measures and show how they can be used to interpret and compare variance matrices. As an illustration, we show that divergence of wing shape in the dipteran family Drosophilidae has proceeded in directions that have relatively high evolvabilities.},

We use the Lande equation to derive new measures of the ability of a variance matrix to allow or constrain evolution in any direction in phenotype space. "Evolvability" captures the ability of a population to evolve in the direction of selection when stabilizing selection is absent. "Conditional evolvability" captures the ability of a population to respond to directional selection in the presence of stabilizing selection on other trait combinations. 

They derive measures of character autonomy and integration from these evolvabilities, and study the properties of these measures and show how they can be used to interpret and compare variance matrices. 

They show using their measures that divergence of wing shape in the dipteran family Drosophilidae has proceeded in directions that have relatively high evolvabilities.

The authors bring up an important point that G matrix structure are interpreted with no reference to particular selection gradients, moreover, the summary measurements and decompositions of G often lack an evolutionary interpretation. As an example, correlation matrix for components of G matrices measures some aspect of similarity, but that has no meaning with regards to evolutionary theory.},

most of us are interested in the relation between phenotype and selective advantage when applied to artificial selection in the population. There are two different approaches, the mather school (birmingham) and lush school (edinburgh).

Mather, in his approach to quantitative genetics, was primarily interested in questions of gene action. His theory, therefore, starts from a consideration of the effects of individual genes, and his experiments are set up with the intention of discovering things about the genes controlling quantitative variation. For instance, how many genes are controlling differences between inbred lines? To what extent can these differences be shown to be chromosomally inherited? To what extent are results affected by linkage? The experimental designs were basically directed at gene action and linkage and have to be evaluated from this point of view. In particular, I would stress that on the whole the experiments of the mather group do not consider a random breeding population to which the results will be applied. In some cases, such an extrapolation to a random breeding population can easily be made, but in the main approach there has been no intention to do this.

The Lush school, on the other hand, has been primarily concerned with observations made on random breeding populations, with the descriptions of the relationships between different individuals in the population, and with the prediction of the response of the population to short-term changes in its environment, using this term in the widest sense. This description is then given entirely in terms of variance compoenents, and it must not be forgotten that it is in essense a static description of the population. It describes the population as it is at the moment, and cannot be expected to be an adequate description of the population as it will be after some generations of selection. The problem of interpretation of these variance components, in terms of gene action, is an extremely difficult one, as we shall see later. In any population the variance is presumably due to many genes. We know neither the magnitude of the individual effects, the frequency of the alleles causing these effects, nor how the genes at different loci interact with one another. The model cannot deal accurately with some situations, and we then have to discard the variance component model and go back to a description of the variance of the population in terms of the individual genes concerned. The effect of inbreeding, for instance, can only be described under the very limiting assumption of completely additive gene action on the character concerned. In predicting the effects of selection we can merely say that the instantaneous rate of selection will be proportional to the additive genetic variation at any instant of time, but we have no good methods of predicting the changes in the additive genetic variance itself.

A further consequence of the two approaches is that they have different residuary legatees. By this I mean that they have different orders of preference for explanations of the response of the population to different changes in its situation. For instance, the Mather school tends to prefer a description of experimental results in terms of linkage rather the pleiotropy. On the other hand, the Lush school, on the whole, would prefer to explain surprising results in selection in terms of pleitropy and only invoke linkage as the very final resort.}

However, the two groups of genes do not differ in the number of molecular functions or the number of protein domains per gene. Thus, pleiotropy is generally caused by a single molecular function involved in multiple biological processes.

In the hope of stimulating research in this area, I review empirical data from natural populations and draw the following conclusions. (1) Considerable additive genetic variance is present for most traits in most populations. (2) Trait correlations do not consistently oppose selection. (3) Adaptive differences between populations often involve dominance and epistasis. (4) Most adaptation is the result of genes of small-to-modest effect, although (5) some genes certainly have larger effects than the others. (6) Adaptation by independent lineages to similar environments is mostly driven by different alleles/genes. (7) Adaptation to new environments is mostly driven by standing genetic variation, although new mutations can be important in some instances. (8) Adaptation is driven by both structural and regulatory genetic variation, with recent studies emphasizing the latter. (9) The ecological effects of organisms, considered as extended phenotypes, are often heritable. Overall, the study of eco-evolutionary dynamics will benefit from perspectives and approaches that emphasize standing genetic variation in many genes of small-to-modest effect acting across multiple traits and that analyze overall adaptation or /`fitness/'. In addition, increasing attention should be paid to dominance, epistasis and regulatory variation.},

Analysis at the level of individual loci and gene frequency distributions has had relatively little impact. Now with access to genomic data, a revolution in which molecular information is being used to enhance response with genomic selection is occurring. The predictions of breeding value still utilize multiple loci throughout the genome and, indeed, are largely compatible with additive and specifically infinitesimal model assumptions.

  Abstract                 = {(i) A computer simulation study has been made of selection on two linked loci in small populations, where both loci were assumed to have additive effects on the character under selection with no interaction between loci. If N is the effective population size, i the intensity of selection in standard units, alpha and beta measure the effects of the two loci on the character under selection as a proportion of the pheno-typic standard deviation and c is the crossover distance between them, it was shown that the selection process can be completely specified by Ni alpha, Ni beta and Nc and the initial gene frequencies and linkage disequilibrium coefficient. It is then easily possible to generalize from computer runs at only one population size. All computer runs assumed an initial population at linkage equilibrium between the two loci. Analysis of the results was greatly simplified by considering the influence of segregation at the second locus on the chance of fixation at the first (defined as the proportion of replicate lines in which the favoured allele was eventually fixed).

(ii) The effects of linkage are sufficiently described by Nc. The relationship between chance of fixation at the limit and linkage distance (expressed as 2Nc/(2Nc + 1)) was linear in the majority of computer runs.

(iii) When gene frequency changes under independent segregation were small, linkage had no effect on the advance under selection. In general, segregation at the second locus had no detectable influence on the chance of fixation at the first if the gene effects at the second were less than one-half those at the first. With larger gene effects at the second locus, the chance of fixation passed through a minimum and then rose again. For two loci to have a mutual influence on one another, their effects on the character under selection should not differ by a factor of more than two.

(iv) Under conditions of suitable relative gene effects, the influence of segregation at the second locus was very dependent on the initial frequency of the desirable allele. The chance of fixation at the first, plotted against initial frequency of the desirable allele at the second, passed through a minimum when the chance of fixation at the second locus was about 0.8.

(v) A transformation was found which made the influence of segregation at the second locus on the chance of fixation at the first almost independent of initial gene frequency at the first and of gene effects at the first locus when these are small.

(vi) In the population of gametes at final fixation, linkage was not at equilibrium and there was an excess of repulsion gametes.

(vii) The results were extended to a consideration of the effect of linkage on the limits under artificial selection. Linkage proved only to be of importance when the two loci had roughly equal effects on the character under selection. The maximum effect on the advance under selection occurred when the chance of fixation at both of the loci was between 0.7 and 0.8. When the advance under selection is most sensitive to changes in recombination value, a doubling of the latter in no case increased the advance under selection by more than about 6\%. The proportion selected to give maximum advance under individual selection (0.5 under independent segregation) was increased, but only very slightly, when linkage is important.

(viii) These phenomena could be satisfactorily accounted for in terms of the time scale of the selection process and the effective size of the population within which changes of gene frequency at the locus with smaller effect must take place.},

We tested the hypothesis that parasitoids with different strategies select for alternative host defense characteristics and in doing so contribute to the maintenance of fitness variation and produce trade-offs among traits. We characterized defense traits of Drosophila when exposed to parasitoids with different host searching behaviors (Aphaereta sp. and Leptopilina boulardi). We used host larvae with different natural alleles of the gene Dopa decarboxylase (Ddc), a gene controlling the production of dopamine and known to influence the immune response against parasitoids. Previous population genetic analyses indicate that our focal alleles are maintained by balancing selection. Genotypes exhibited a trade-off between the immune response against Aphaereta sp. and the ability to avoid parasitism by L. boulardi. We also identified a trade-off between the ability to avoid parasitism by L. boulardi and larval competitive ability as indicated by differences in foraging and feeding behavior. Genotypes differed in dopamine levels potentially explaining variation in these traits. Our results highlight the potential role of parasitoid biodiversity on host fitness variation and implicate Ddc as an antagonistic pleiotropic locus influencing larval fitness traits.},

Develops MIPoD (microevolutionary inference from patterns of divergence). A neutral model of evolution by genetic drift that depends on effective population size and the G matrix predicts a probability distribution for divergence of population trait means on a phylogeny. Basic idea is that Evolution of G minus selection really only depends on Ne mostly, and that divergence in means z_bar's between two populations can be tested for neutral evolution. They define variance-covariance matrix for means z_bar(t) denoted D(t) as functions of G and Ne (assumed to be uncorrelated: lande 1979), this gives the pdf for z_bar(t) which gives a null for testing divergence by neutral evolution; the time dependent expression for D(t) is derived and expressed in equation (7) using mutation drift balance estimates from lande 1980 and Lynch Hill 1986.

Maximum likelihood (ML) framework developed to compare independent direct estimates of G with the ML estimates based on the observed pattern of trait divergence among taxa.

Hohenlohe and Arnold test their neutral model on data for the garter snake (Thamnophis spp.) for two traits (body and tail vertebral counts).

MY COMMENTS
In our discussion, we should say something about the instability of G, but also comment on the other features that G is measured by. In particular, for this model, the principle components are always preserved.

  Abstract                 = {Recent work has called attention to large differences among traits in the amount of standardized genetic variance they possess. There are four general factors which could play a role in causing this variation: mutation, elimination of deleterious variation, selection of favorable alleles, and balancing selection. Three factors could directly influence the mutational variability of traits: canalization, the mutational target size, and the timing of trait expression. Here I carry out simple tests of the importance of some of these factors using data from Drosophila melanogaster. I compiled information from the literature on the mutational and standing genetic variances in outbred populations, inferred the relative mutational target size of each trait, its a timing of expression, and used models of life history to calculate fitness sensitivities for each trait. Mutation variation seems to play an important role, as it is highly correlated with standing variance. The target size hypothesis was supported by a significant correlation between mutational variance and inferred target size. There was also a significant relationship between the timing of trait expression and mutational variance. These hypotheses are confounded by a correlation between timing and target size. The elimination and canalization hypotheses were not supported by these data, suggesting that they play a quantitatively less important role in determining overall variances. Additional information concerning the pleiotropic consequences of mutations would help to validate the fitness sensitivities used to test the elimination and canalization hypotheses.},

  Abstract                 = {There are two distinct reasons for making comparisons of genetic variation for quantitative characters. The first is to compare evolvabilities, or ability to respond to selection, and the second is to make inferences about the forces that maintain genetic variability. Measures of variation that are standardized by the trait mean, such as the additive genetic coefficient of variation, are appropriate for both purposes. Variation has usually been compared as narrow sense heritabilities, but this is almost always an inappropriate comparative measure of evolvability and variability. Coefficients of variation were calculated from 842 estimates of trait means, variances and heritabilities in the literature. Traits closely related to fitness have higher additive genetic and nongenetic variability by the coefficient of variation criterion than characters under weak selection. This is the reverse of the accepted conclusion based on comparisons of heritability. The low heritability of fitness components is best explained by their high residual variation. The high additive genetic and residual variability of fitness traits might be explained by the great number of genetic and environmental events they are affected by, or by a lack of stabilizing selection to reduce their phenotypic variance. Over one-third of the quantitative genetics papers reviewed did not report trait means or variances. Researchers should always report these statistics, so that measures of variation appropriate to a variety of situations may be calculated.},

-concerned with evolvability and maintenance of variation in quantitative traits and comparing them using mean standardized measures
-really pushes the idea of using "relative evolvability of fitness" to compare evolvability of traits
-really pushes the idea of using "coefficients of variation" to compare variances of different quantitative genetic traits

COMMENTS
-life history traits have lower narrow sense heritabilities, but h^2 is not appropriate measure of evolvability
-appropriate measure of "relative evolvability of fitness" denoted I_A is given by I_A = V_A / X_bar^2 = (CV_A / 100)^2
-I_A also appropriate indicator of the variability of fitness, as large values must be result of powerful forces maintaining genetic variance
-CV_A seems a reasonable dimensionless criterion for comparing genetic variabilities (used by Charlesworth 1984, 1987)
-some problems exist with CV_A; ex. high standardized phenotypic variability might suggest lack of strong stablizing selection
-fitness components posses V_A (see follow up entry)

-reviewed quantiative genetic studies of animal populations, specifically data sets that met 5 criteria
1) characters assumed to be under strong directional selection, or weak stabilizing selection
2) population studied may be assumed to be near genetic equilibrium
3) population studied was outbred
4) additive genetic variance was estimated using relatively unbiased methods
5) variances are reported in untransformed scale

DISCUSSION
-Fitness traits tend to integrate variability over the lifetime of the organism, hence likely that larger number of loci, wider range of environmental variables, and more interaction among them affect fitness traits than morphological ones
-under most models of the maintenance of genetic variance, genetic variance in trait will tend to be correlated with the number of loci which affect it
-difficult to obtain precise estimates of genetic variance for traits with low h^2;

  Abstract                 = {The genetic variance-covariance matrix, G, is determined in part by functional architecture, the pathways by which variation in genotype influences phenotype. I develop a simple architectural model for G for two traits under directional selection constrained by their dependence on a common limiting resource. I assume that genetic variance is maintained by mutation-selection balance. The relative numbers of loci that play a role in acquiring versus allocating a limiting resource play a crucial role in determining genetic covariance. If many loci are involved in acquiring a resource, genetic covariance may be either negative or positive at equilibrium, depending on the fitness function and the input of mutational variance. The form of G does not necessarily reveal the constraint on resource acquisition inherent in the system, and therefore studies estimating G do not test for the existence of life-history tradeoffs. Characters may evolve in patterns that are unpredictable from G. Experiments are suggested that would indicate if this model could explain observations of positive genetic covariance.},

  Abstract                 = {We have reviewed the available data on VM, the amount of genetic variation in phenotypic traits produced each generation by mutation. We use these data to make several qualitative tests of the mutation-selection balance hypothesis for the maintenance of genetic variance (MSB). To compare VM values, we use three dimensionless quantities: mutational heritability, the mutational coefficient of variation, CVM; and the ratio of the standing genetic variance to VM, VG/VM. Since genetic coefficients of variation for life history traits are larger than those for morphological traits, we predict that under MSB, life history traits should also have larger CVM. This is confirmed; life history traits have a median CVM value more than six times higher than that for morphological traits. VG/VM approximates the persistence time of mutations under MSB in an infinite population. In order for MSB to hold, VG/VM must be small, substantially less than 1000, and life history traits should have smaller values than morphological traits. VG/VM averages about 50 generations for life history traits and 100 generations for morphological traits. These observations are all consistent with the predictions of a mutation-selection balance model.},

JB explain that while statistical models have had success in short to medium term effects of selection, they cannot say anything about the mechanistic genetic basis of the traits they describe, which are important for predicting the medium to long-term evolution. I guess this is kind of made clear with the fact that allele frequencies matter in the QG models themselves. In the intro, the imply that finding information about the mechanisms that influence genetic variation in complex traits could prove useful for our understanding about evolution in complex diseases.

An interesting paper that was touched on in the discussion of heritabilities was the Houle 1992 paper which showed that heritabilities for traits more closely related to fitness (life history traits) was lower, but only because V_E was larger, and V_G was in fact much higher, than in other kinds of traits. Morphological traits have higher heritabilities.

On the subject of mutations, JB state that mutation experiments with inbred lines show that V_m fall with 10^-3 V_E to 10^-2 V_E (Lynch 1988 and Lynch Walsh 1998). Net fitness effects of mutations can differ between species: mutations in D. melanogaster on average reduce fitness, while in arabidopsis thaliana, the average effect is zero (Keightley 1996, fry 1999 and shaw et al 2000)

In the discussion about the maintenance of genetic variation by mutations, JB state that given data and an assumption of a gaussian distribution of f(x) = "frequency of effect x on a trait" as each locus (where x is the effect of an allele on a trait at a locus), the equilibrium condition for genetic variance and as it depends on mutaitonal variance (3.1), says that the effective number of loci is small, while the effect size must be large.

  Abstract                 = {Evolvability is a key characteristic of any evolving system, and the concept of evolvability serves as a unifying theme in a wide range of disciplines related to evolutionary theory. The field of quantitative genetics provides a framework for the exploration of evolvability with the promise to produce insights of global importance. With respect to the quantitative genetics of biological systems, the parameters most relevant to evolvability are the G-matrix, which describes the standing additive genetic variances and covariances for a suite of traits, and the M-matrix, which describes the effects of new mutations on genetic variances and covariances. A population's immediate response to selection is governed by the G-matrix. However, evolvability is also concerned with the ability of mutational processes to produce adaptive variants, and consequently the M-matrix is a crucial quantitative genetic parameter. Here, we explore the evolution of evolvability by using analytical theory and simulation-based models to examine the evolution of the mutational correlation, r_mu, the key parameter determining the nature of genetic constraints imposed by M. The model uses a diploid, sexually reproducing population of finite size experiencing stabilizing selection on a two-trait phenotype. We assume that the mutational correlation is a third quantitative trait determined by multiple additive loci. An individual's value of the mutational correlation trait determines the correlation between pleiotropic effects of new alleles when they arise in that individual. Our results show that the mutational correlation, despite the fact that it is not involved directly in the specification of an individual's fitness, does evolve in response to selection on the bivariate phenotype. The mutational variance exhibits a weak tendency to evolve to produce alignment of the M-matrix with the adaptive landscape, but is prone to erratic fluctuations as a consequence of genetic drift. The interpretation of this result is that the evolvability of the population is capable of a response to selection, and whether this response results in an increase or decrease in evolvability depends on the way in which the bivariate phenotypic optimum is expected to move. Interestingly, both analytical and simulation results show that the mutational correlation experiences disruptive selection, with local fitness maxima at -1 and +1. Genetic drift counteracts the tendency for the mutational correlation to persist at these extreme values, however. Our results also show that an evolving M-matrix tends to increase stability of the G-matrix under most circumstances. Previous studies of G-matrix stability, which assume nonevolving M-matrices, consequently may overestimate the level of instability of G relative to what might be expected in natural systems. Overall, our results indicate that evolvability can evolve in natural systems in a way that tends to result in alignment of the G-matrix, the M-matrix, and the adaptive landscape, and that such evolution tends to stabilize the G-matrix over evolutionary time.},

Results show that the mutational correlation, despite the fact that it is not involved directly in the specification of an individual's fitness, does evolve in response to selection on the bivariate phenotype, assuming that the mutational correlation is a third quantitative trait determined by multiple additive loci. 

An individual's value of the mutational correlation trait determines the correlation between pleiotropic effects of new alleles when they arise in that individual. 

The mutational variance exhibits a weak tendency to evolve to produce alignment of the M-matrix with the adaptive landscape, but is prone to erratic fluctuations as a consequence of genetic drift. The interpretation of this result is that the evolvability of the population is capable of a response to selection, and whether this response results in an increase or decrease in evolvability depends on the way in which the bivariate phenotypic optimum is expected to move. 

Interestingly, both analytical and simulation results show that the mutational correlation experiences disruptive selection, with local fitness maxima at -1 and +1. 
Genetic drift counteracts the tendency for the mutational correlation to persist at these extreme values, however. Our results also show that an evolving M-matrix tends to increase stability of the G-matrix under most circumstances. Previous studies of G-matrix stability, which assume nonevolving M-matrices, consequently may overestimate the level of instability of G relative to what might be expected in natural systems. Overall, our results indicate that evolvability can evolve in natural systems in a way that tends to result in alignment of the G-matrix, the M-matrix, and the adaptive landscape, and that such evolution tends to stabilize the G-matrix over evolutionary time.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantitative genetics theory provides a framework that predicts the effects of selection on a phenotype consisting of a suite of complex traits. However, the ability of existing theory to reconstruct the history of selection or to predict the future trajectory of evolution depends upon the evolutionary dynamics of the genetic variance-covariance matrix (G-matrix). Thus, the central focus of the emerging field of comparative quantitative genetics is the evolution of the G-matrix. Existing analytical theory reveals little about the dynamics of G, because the problem is too complex to be mathematically tractable. As a first step toward a predictive theory of G-matrix evolution, our goal was to use stochastic computer models to investigate factors that might contribute to the stability of G over evolutionary time. We were concerned with the relatively simple case of two quantitative traits in a population experiencing stabilizing selection, pleiotropic mutation, and random genetic drift. Our results show that G-matrix stability is enhanced by strong correlational selection and large effective population size. In addition, the nature of mutations at pleiotropic loci can dramatically influence stability of G. In particular, when a mutation at a single locus simultaneously changes the value of the two traits (due to pleiotropy) and these effects are correlated, mutation can generate extreme stability of G. Thus, the central message of our study is that the empirical question regarding G-matrix stability is not necessarily a general question of whether G is stable across various taxonomic levels. Rather, we should expect the G-matrix to be extremely stable for some suites of characters and unstable for others over similar spans of evolutionary time.},

  Abstract                 = {In quantitative genetics, the genetic architecture of traits, described in terms of variances and covariances, plays a major role in determining the trajectory of evolutionary change. Hence, the genetic variance-covariance matrix (G-matrix) is a critical component of modern quantitative genetics theory. Considerable debate has surrounded the issue of G-matrix constancy because unstable G-matrices provide major difficulties for evolutionary inference. Empirical studies and analytical theory have not resolved the debate. Here we present the results of stochastic models of G-matrix evolution in a population responding to an adaptive landscape with an optimum that moves at a constant rate. This study builds on the previous results of stochastic simulations of G-matrix stability under stabilizing selection arising from a stationary optimum. The addition of a moving optimum leads to several important new insights. First, evolution along genetic lines of least resistance increases stability of the orientation of the G-matrix relative to stabilizing selection alone. Evolution across genetic lines of least resistance decreases G-matrix stability. Second, evolution in response to a continuously changing optimum can produce persistent maladaptation for a correlated trait, even if its optimum does not change. Third, the retrospective analysis of selection performs very well when the mean G-matrix (?) is known with certainty, indicating that covariance between G and the directional selection gradient ? is usually small enough in magnitude that it introduces only a small bias in estimates of the net selection gradient. Our results also show, however, that the contemporary ?-matrix only serves as a rough guide to ?. The most promising approach for the estimation of ? is probably through comparative phylogenetic analysis. Overall, our results show that directional selection actually can increase stability of the G-matrix and that retrospective analysis of selection is inherently feasible. One major remaining challenge is to gain a sufficient understanding of the G-matrix to allow the confident estimation of ?.},

Clonal interference has been demonstrated in viruses7 and bacteria8 but not in a eukaryote, and a detailed molecular characterization is lacking. Here we use three different fluorescent markers to visualize the dynamics of asexually evolving yeast populations. For each adaptive clone within one of our evolving populations, we identified the underlying mutations, monitored their population frequencies and used microarrays to characterize changes in the transcriptome. These results represent the most detailed molecular characterization of experimental evolution to date and provide direct experimental evidence supporting both the clonal interference and the multiple mutation models.},

COMMENTS:
-It might be worth looking into Lenski's experiments for estimates of parameters since E. coli certainly fits our population profile.
-Experimental popluation was about 10^9 cells
-Doesn't seem like much data is given that would be useful for determining parameters
-There was one mutation that seemed to sweep in the yellow group (MUK1), which might be worth looking at in further papers. The paper doesn't say what the associated protein does.

If the effects of mutant genes on the trait are symmetrically distributed and they are unlinked, the variance of mutant effects is not an important parameter. If the distribution is skewed, unless effects or the population size is small, the proportion of mutants that have increasing effect is the critical parameter. With linkage the distribution of genotypic values in the population becomes skewed downward and the equilibrium genetic variance and response are smaller as disequilibrium becomes important. Linkage effects are greater when the mutational variance is contributed by many genes of small effect than few of large effect, and are greater when the majority of mutants increase rather than decrease the trait because genes that are of large effect or are deleterious do not segregate for long.

Many biologists address evolutionary questions by estimating phenotypic selection and genetic (co)variances (G matrices). Simultaneously, an increasing number of studies have applied quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping methods to dissect variation. Both conceptual and practical difficulties have isolated these two foci of quantitative genetics. A conceptual integration follows from the recognition that QTL allele frequencies are the essential variables relating the G-matrix to marker-based mapping experiments. Breeding designs initiated from randomly selected parental genotypes can be used to estimate QTL-specific genetic (co)variances. These statistics appropriately distill allelic variation and provide an explicit population context for QTL mapping estimates. Within this framework, one can parse the G-matrix into a set of mutually exclusive genomic components and ask whether these parts are similar or dissimilar in their respective features, for example the magnitude of phenotypic effects and the extent and nature of pleiotropy. As these features are critical determinants of sustained response to selection, the integration of QTL mapping methods into G-matrix estimation can provide a concrete, genetically based experimental program to investigate the evolutionary potential of natural populations.},

The framework is also extended to allow for other deterministic evolutionary forces, including migration and mutation. Exact recursions that fully describe the state of the population are presented; these are implemented in a computer algebra package (available on the Web at http://helios.bto.ed.ac.uk/evolgen). Despite the generality of our framework, it can describe evolutionary dynamics exactly by just two equations. These recursions can be further simplified using a "quasi-linkage equilibrium" (QLE) approximation.

  Abstract                 = {An integral assumption of many models of morphometric evolution is the equality of the genetic variance-covariance structure across evolutionary time. To examine this assumption, the quantitative-genetic aspects of morphometric form are examined for eight pelvic traits in laboratory rats (Rattus norvegicus) and random-bred ICR mice (Mus musculus). In both species, all traits are significantly heritable, and there are significant phenotypic and genetic correlations among traits, although environmental correlations among the eight traits are low. The size relations among the pelvic variables are isometric. Three matrix-permutation tests are used to examine similarity of phenotypic, genetic, and environmental covariance and correlation matrices within and between species. Independent patterns of morphometric covariation and correlation arise from genetic and environmental effects within each species and from environmental effects between species. The patterns of phenotypic and genetic covariation and correlation are similar within each species, and the phenotypic and genetic correlations are also similar between these species. However, genetic covariance matrices show no significant statistical association between species. It is suggested that the assumption of equality of genetic variance-covariance structures across divergent taxa should be approached with caution.},

A dynamic theory of life history evolution is derived by synthesizing population demography with quantitative genetics. In a population under weak selection with a nearly stable age distribution, the relative fitness of individuals with a particular life history phenotype can be approximated as an average of age-specific relative fecundity and mortality rates, weighted respectively by the present productivity and future reproductive value of each age-class. An adaptive topography is constructed showing that, with phenotype- and age-specific fecundity and mortality rates constant in time, evolution of the mean life history maximizes the intrinsic rate of increase of a population. However, the rate and direction of evolution in response to selection are strongly influenced by genetic correlations among characters. Negative genetic correlations among major components of fitness are often obscured phenotypically by positive environmental correlations, but commonly constitute the ultimate constraint on life history evolution, as illustrated by artificial selection experiments. Methods are suggested for measuring selective forces and evolutionary constraints that effect life history characters in natural populations.},

Lande develops a quantitative genetics model for the life history traits. The basic set up is grounded on the Lokta Keyfitz model for age structured populations in demographic equilibrium. He derives how the malthusian growth rate depends on G (see equation 14). traits are assumed to have normal distribution.

In the discussion he describes why negative genetic correlations should be expected to persist among characters components. Also states that near an equilibrium, major components of fitness tend to have negative genetic correlations, which may not be reflected in the phenotypic covariances because of positive correlations among them from the environment. This is sort of in line with the idea of the Y model analysis in which variance in acquisition being large makes negative correlations from allocation constraints less likely. Note that this paper doesn't acutally derive any equations or expressions that say that genetic correlations among fitness components should be negative. In fact, he only gives a verbal description of why this must be so in the discussion.},

This paper focuses on deriving equilibrium formulas for the evolution of multivariate phenotypes in large, randomly mating populations. The assumption requires selection to be much smaller than twice the harmonic mean of recombination rate between loci with interacting fitnesses, then linkage disequilibria is negligible and pleiotropy is the main cause of genetic correlations between characters. He then gets expressions for the dynamics of gentic covariances under these assumptions (21b for transformed covariances, 21c for equilibrium covariances, and 22a for the G matrix dynamics in equilibrium). This work is a sort of multivariate form of his 1977 work. The key idea here is that in 21c, we find that the solutions depend specifically on mutations (matrix U) and selection (matrix W) and environmental variances (\tilde W = W +E). Again, this is under the assumption of selection being weak relative to the recombination rate, but I don't think this assumption is needed in his 1977 paper, or at least he doesn't state that he needs it.},

Under some simple conditions on the pattern of phenotypic and genetic covariation within populations, selection only on body size, certain types of multivariate selection, and random genetic drift in a stochastic phylogeny are each expected to produce allometric evolution, i.e., straight lines or linear regressions on logarithmic coordinates. The orientation of these lines is determined by genetic parameters of the populations. Using this theory, phylogenetic or comparative information can be combined with experimental data on population genetic parameters to test hypotheses about past selective forces. Data from selection experiments on brain and body weights in mice support the conclusions that [1] the short-term differentiation of brain and body sizes in very closely related mammalian forms resulted either from directional selection mostly on body size with changes in brain sizes largely a genetically correlated response, or from random genetic drift; [2] during the long-term allometric diversification within most mammalian orders there has been more net directional selection on brain sizes than on body sizes. It is suggested that encephalization in primates decreased the genetic correlation between brain size and body size within populations, which facilitated further encephalization in the human lineage by avoiding antagonistic selection on brain and body sizes.

KEYWORDS: Lande's Equation, Multivariate Selection, Breeder's Equation

Start of introduction gives citation of where Darwin stated his view that covariation between characters was important and connected (although not understood) to the correlated responses to artificial and natural selection (p.402). Brain and body weight example emphasized initially and in remainder of paper. Bottom of p.403 states major assumptions of when correlated reponses to selection can be estimated through quantitiative genetics. Top of p.405 suggests that retrospective selction studies can be done when G is constant or atleast proportional, while further down, he states reasons for why it might be okay to even consider constant/proportional G. On pages 405-406 he derives the breeder's equation for multivariate selection. He does also admit that covariation patterns may evolve over long periods of time from changes in selection pressures, and certainly with major functional transitions.

The classical models are still used to interpret data from natural populations. But contrary to their assumptions, most metrical characters in natural populations are usually thought to be under a type of selection which depletes polygenic variation.

Take away: genetic variation can be maintined by mutation and selection, along with environmental variation.

Just that in this model, genetic variances are maintained by selection and mutations. In the statement of the model, they are not clear about what they are assuming, but some minor discussion of other notable points are below equation (9).

A particular detailed model shows that certain aspects of the genetic system are moulded by stabilizing selection while others are selectively neutral.

Follows same approach as his other papers. Finds and solve dynamical equations for the covariance terms between traits. The main recurrence equation is given in (19), and the equilibrium condition for genetic variance is given in 21a-21c for the covariances and the amount of expressed variance expressed by each loci, and the additive gentic variance.

One of the main goals of the paper is to show that genetic variation can be maintained by mutation even with strong stabilizing selection.
Assumptions:
(1) At the ith locus, each allele mutates with probability fii each generation, and the distribution of mutant effects is the same for all alleles. The variance of the mutational changes at the ith locus is denoted as m\. At each locus, the changes produced by mutation have a mean of zero so that there is no mutation pressure influencing the population mean.
(2) The population mates randomly with respect to the character.
(3) The effective population size is large enough to ignore genetic drift.
(4) There is no genotype-environment interaction and the allelic effects are additive within and between loci.}

Selective effects are readily detectable in characters that do not change with age, such as meristic traits or adult characters in species with determinate growth. Ontogenetic characters, including allometric growth rates, can be analyzed in longitudinal studies where individuals are followed through time. Following an approach pioneered by Pearson (1903), this analysis helps to reveal the target(s) of selection, and to quantify its intensity, without identifying the selective agent(s). By accounting for indirect selection through correlated characters, separate forces of directional and stabilizing (or disruptive) selection acting directly on each character can be measured. These directional and stabilizing selection coefficients are respectively the parameters that describe the best linear and quadratic approximations to the selective surface of individual fitness as a function of the phenotypic characters. The theory is illustrated by estimating selective forces on morphological characters influencing survival in pentatomid bugs and in house sparrows during severe weather conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {The fate of a newly arising beneficial mutation depends on many factors, such as the population size and the availability and fitness effects of other mutations that accumulate in the population. It has proved difficult to understand how these factors influence the trajectories of particular mutations, since experiments have primarily focused on characterizing successful clones emerging from a small number of evolving populations. Here, we present the results of a massively parallel experiment designed to measure the full spectrum of possible fates of new beneficial mutations in hundreds of experimental yeast populations, whether these mutations are ultimately successful or not. Using strains in which a particular class of beneficial mutation is detectable by fluorescence, we followed the trajectories of these beneficial mutations across 592 independent populations for 1000 generations. We find that the fitness advantage provided by individual mutations plays a surprisingly small role. Rather, underlying {\textquotedblleft}background{\textquotedblright} genetic variation is quickly generated in our initially clonal populations and plays a crucial role in determining the fate of each individual beneficial mutation in the evolving population.},

  Abstract                 = {Evolutionary adaptation to a constant environment is often accompanied by specialization and a reduction of fitness in other environments. We assayed the ability of the Lenski Escherichia coli populations to grow on a range of carbon sources after 50,000 generations of adaptation on glucose. Using direct measurements of growth rates, we demonstrated that declines in performance were much less widespread than suggested by previous results from Biolog assays of cellular respiration. Surprisingly, there were many performance increases on a variety of substrates. In addition to the now famous example of citrate, we observed several other novel gains of function for organic acids that the ancestral strain only marginally utilized. Quantitative growth data also showed that strains with a higher mutation rate exhibited significantly more declines, suggesting that most metabolic erosion was driven by mutation accumulation and not by physiological tradeoffs. These reductions in growth by mutator strains were ameliorated by growth at lower temperature, consistent with the hypothesis that this metabolic erosion is largely caused by destabilizing mutations to the associated enzymes. We further hypothesized that reductions in growth rate would be greatest for substrates used most differently from glucose, and we used flux balance analysis to formulate this question quantitatively. To our surprise, we found no significant relationship between decreases in growth and dissimilarity to glucose metabolism. Taken as a whole, these data suggest that in a single resource environment, specialization does not mainly result as an inevitable consequence of adaptive tradeoffs, but rather due to the gradual accumulation of disabling mutations in unused portions of the genome.},

Here I review an experiment with Escherichia coli, in which 12 populations were founded from the same ancestral strain and have evolved for almost 30 years and more than 65,000 generations under the same conditions. The tension between divergence and convergence has been a major focus of this experiment. I summarize analyses of competitive fitness, correlated responses to different environments, cell morphology, the capacity to use a previously untapped resource, mutation rates, genomic changes, and within-population polymorphisms. These analyses reveal convergence, divergence, and often a complicated mix thereof. Complications include concordance in the direction of evolutionary change with sustained quantitative variation among populations, and the potential for a given trait to exhibit divergence on one timescale and convergence on another. Despite these complications, which also occur in nature, experiments provide a powerful way to study evolutionary convergence based on analyzing replicate lineages that experience the same environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Evolution of large asexual cell populations underlies [sim]30\% of deaths worldwide, including those caused by bacteria, fungi, parasites, and cancer. However, the dynamics underlying these evolutionary processes remain poorly understood because they involve many competing beneficial lineages, most of which never rise above extremely low frequencies in the population. To observe these normally hidden evolutionary dynamics, we constructed a sequencing-based ultra high-resolution lineage tracking system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that allowed us to monitor the relative frequencies of [sim]500,000 lineages simultaneously. In contrast to some expectations, we found that the spectrum of fitness effects of beneficial mutations is neither exponential nor monotonic. Early adaptation is a predictable consequence of this spectrum and is strikingly reproducible, but the initial small-effect mutations are soon outcompeted by rarer large-effect mutations that result in variability between replicates. These results suggest that early evolutionary dynamics may be deterministic for a period of time before stochastic effects become important.},

  Review                   = {RESULTS
-spectrum of fitness effects is neither exponential nor monotonic, but the spectrum at the lower end do lead to predicable dynamics that are reproducible
-For E1 beneficial mutaitons of small effects (2\%<s<5\%) dominate at the onset (t<72 gens), but are outcompeted by larger effect mutations (s>10\%) later in both replicates (t>112 gens). The dynamics of evolution in the latter time period are much more stochastic, because these mutations are rare and their establishment times have larger variances.
-For E2 beneficial mutaitons of small effects (2\%<s<5\%) where outcompeted by larger effect mutations (s>10\%) much earlier, and by ~132 gens small effect mutations were a very minor fraction of the population total.
-other findings
-Double mutants are rare before 168 gens, so most of this experiment falls into the situation described by gerrish and lenksi 1998 framework in which the effect of multiple mutations is not relevant. They estimate that possibly 0.2\% of adaptive mutant lineages, 50 of their inferred estimates s and tau, are the result of double mutants.
-Also, for the time range that they examine, effects from ecology leading to frequency-dependent selection can be ignored.
-beneficial mutations observed were ~20,000 in E1 and ~11,000 in E2 for muations of low effect (2-5\%), and 5,000 in E1 and 3,000 in E2 of large effect (~10\%) 

ORGANISM (Saccharomyces cerevisiae):
-Eukaryotic fungus that can be haploid or diploid (preferential form), and reproduce in either state through mitosis 
-when under stress, diploids undergo meiosis and then sporulate to 4 haploid cells with exchanged genetic material.
-two mating types "a" and "alpha"
-cell size is roughly 5-10 micrometers
-1 gen = time to double ~ 100 minutes

COMMENTS
-we need to understand evolutionary dynamics to know which adaptive mutations are driving evolution and which are consequential.
-populations of cells are roughly 1e8 
-another important point is that their is potentially a beneficial mutation rate for each selectioin coefficient size, so we are really after an effective mutation rate as well as an effective selection coefficient.
-levy points out the barrier 1/Ub which is is about when multiple mutation effects kick for a lineage that has nearly fixed.
-section on beneficial mutation rates sites s>5\% occur at rate ~1e-6 /cell/gen
-fluctuation test: refers to using luria and delbruck's work to estimate the mtuation rate
-ancestors have spontaneous mutation rate in non repeated regions ~4e-10
-the trajectories in fig 2a are most illustrative of the experiment in terms of what data was collected. Every 8 gens the frequencies are measured and used to extrapolate their cell count as a function of time. These are the red trajectories shown in the figure.
-section 11.1 in the supplement provides the way in which they inferred mutation rates for given selection coeff size, but there seem to be some typos and unclear steps in the derivation of formula 101. Just move forward and maybe ask about it later.
-Its important to note that in section 11.1 they provide the units of the mesurements, i.e T = generations, s = 1/generations,
-breakdown of the predominant s deterministic approximation occurs for roughly s>0.08
-figure 41 (supp) gives a nice representation of the dynamics of s_dom in their analysis, and explains why it will have discontinuous behavior as a result of the shape of \mu(s)
-figure 43 (supp) gives a comparison of two methods to determine the beneficial mutation rate in relation to the size of the selection coefficient.
-the explanation for the estimates of the fraction of mutants in region 3, right before creating E1 and E2 replicate experiments is explained near formula (87)
-finding indicate that for t<72 gens, increases in mean fitness are being driven by small effect mutations 2\%<s<5\%, while at about 112 gens ~100 of the most beneficial mutations (s>10\%) are driving most of the observed increases.

EXPERIMENT:
-figure 39 of supplement shows the preparation process leading up to the formation of the two replicate experiments
-generated yeast lineages by inserting a random 20 nucleotide barcode at a single location in their genome with landing pad in a neutral site (using plasmid library of ~5e5 barcodes)
-barcoding took 48 generations, in which adaptive mutations have occured to produce barcoded yeast library
-replicate experminents, labeled E1 and E2, using library were evolved for 168 gens with serial batch culture diluted 1:250 ever ~8 gens when the pop bottle neck was reached (~7e7 cells)
-during execution of replicate experiments frequencies of lineages were measured by isolating genomic DNA from pooled population (isolates used for dilution)
-supplement in 1.3 gives table with symbols and approximate measured values, Ne = 6e8, mean increase in fitness is 6\% in E1 at t = 112

METHOD FOR ESTIMATING TAU AND S: 
1) develop a model for noise to account for the behavior of drift causing a lineage to fix, or measurement errors in sequencing
2) use model of noise and calculate probability that trajectory explained by mutation with fitness effect s having established time tau, over broad range of pairs (i.e. using prior distrib)
3) if above probability exceeds probability that no beneficial mutation occurs, define the trajectory as adaptive
4) estimates of s and tau for each adaptive lineage are combined to calculate a second measure of increase in mean fitness, which agrees with first and means that most beneficial mutations driving increases in mean fitness have been detected

  Abstract                 = {An evolutionary response to selection requires genetic variation; however, even if it exists, then the genetic details of the variation can constrain adaptation. In the simplest case, unlinked loci and uncorrelated phenotypes respond directly to multivariate selection and permit unrestricted paths to adaptive peaks. By contrast, {\textquoteleft}antagonistic{\textquoteright} pleiotropic loci may constrain adaptation by affecting variation of many traits and limiting the direction of trait correlations to vectors that are not favoured by selection. However, certain pleiotropic configurations may improve the conditions for adaptive evolution. Here, we present evidence that the Arabidopsis thaliana gene FRI (FRIGIDA) exhibits {\textquoteleft}adaptive{\textquoteright} pleiotropy, producing trait correlations along an axis that results in two adaptive strategies. Derived, low expression FRI alleles confer a {\textquoteleft}drought escape{\textquoteright} strategy owing to fast growth, low water use efficiency and early flowering. By contrast, a dehydration avoidance strategy is conferred by the ancestral phenotype of late flowering, slow growth and efficient water use during photosynthesis. The dehydration avoidant phenotype was recovered when genotypes with null FRI alleles were transformed with functional alleles. Our findings indicate that the well-documented effects of FRI on phenology result from differences in physiology, not only a simple developmental switch.},

  Abstract                 = {It could be argued that biometrical genetics is the foremost contribution of Birmingham to the world of learning in the present century. For this, the major credit goes to Professor Mather, and secondly to his principal collaborators, J. L. Jinks and B. J. Haynian. Biometrical Genetics was first published in 1949, with K. Mather as sole author [cf. XIX, p. 913]. It has undoubtedly been one of the most influential monographs of recent times. In the ensuing twenty years, extensive research into and extension of the ideas adumbrated in Mather's book have taken place, largely at Birmingham University, and the present second edition, of which Professor Jinks is now coauthor, though recognizably based on its predecessor, is so greatly enlarged as virtually to constitute a new work. It is the best guide to the research programme that Professor Mather has inspired. The present edition comprises twelve chapters. The first, on the genetical foundation, does not differ greatly from what went before; perhaps the mystique in which polygenes were originally enshrouded is now toned down. Chapter 2, on Characters, also follows the lines of the corresponding chapter in the earlier book. Chapter 3, however, is considerably changed and includes a description of recent work on the biometrical analysis of plasmatic variation. Scaling tests and scale transformation have been transferred to the next chapter, where they follow the treatment of additive and dominant components. It is difficult to avoid the impression that scale transformation is still the Achilles' heel of much of the elegant mathematical edifice which the authors present to us, especially when one finds, as is pointed out on p. 82, that a "scale which is satisfactory for fitting an additive-dominance model" may conflict with the "one which will normalize the distributions within the non-segregating generations". Chapter 5 has much new material and deals at length with nonallelic interaction, genotype x environment interaction and heterosis. In chapter 6, we pass on to the potentialities of 2nd degree statistics; this chapter reproduces much of the former chapter 4 on the partitioning of variance, with an interesting addition on weighted analysis. The chapter on linkage follows along the lines of the former chapter, but new examples are taken; in its final section the analysis of genotype x environment interaction proceeds one stage further. Chapter 8, in addition to treating randombreeding populations, formerly treated in chapter 4, also deals with the genetic study of twins, the genetics of experimental populations and the effect of partial inbreeding. Diallel analysis has been amongst the major preoccupation of the Birmingham School and is expounded at length in Chapter 9. Various special cases are treated in the next chapter, namely sex linkage, maternal effects, and the genetics of haploids and polyploids. The last two chapters follow the general lines of the final two chapters of the first edition. The first deals with the number of effective factors and the rate of advance under selection, both matters where the concordance between theory and practice has been unimpressive. The second, entitled Experiments and concepts, is able to review many carefully set up genetical experiments where the first edition was only able to refer to one as fully adequate, and even this one is not included in this chapter of the second edition. Opportunity is also taken here to attempt a rebuttal of some of the weightier criticims that current biometrical genetics has had to meet, notably by Gilbert [cf. XXXI, 2873], but hardly with sufficient force to disarm a persistent critic. The number of references in the bibliography has trebled in comparison with the former edition, and the current volume may be confidently recommended as definitive within its field.},

  Abstract                 = {Adaptation lies at the heart of Darwinian evolution. Accordingly, numerous studies have tried to provide a formal framework for the description of the adaptive process. Of these, two complementary modeling approaches have emerged: While so-called adaptive-walk models consider adaptation from the successive fixation of de novo mutations only, quantitative genetic models assume that adaptation proceeds exclusively from preexisting standing genetic variation. The latter approach, however, has focused on short-term evolution of population means and variances rather than on the statistical properties of adaptive substitutions. Our aim is to combine these two approaches by describing the ecological and genetic factors that determine the genetic basis of adaptation from standing genetic variation in terms of the effect-size distribution of individual alleles. Specifically, we consider the evolution of a quantitative trait to a gradually changing environment. By means of analytical approximations, we derive the distribution of adaptive substitutions from standing genetic variation, that is, the distribution of the phenotypic effects of those alleles from the standing variation that become fixed during adaptation. Our results are checked against individual-based simulations. We find that, compared to adaptation from de novo mutations, (i) adaptation from standing variation proceeds by the fixation of more alleles of small effect and (ii) populations that adapt from standing genetic variation can traverse larger distances in phenotype space and, thus, have a higher potential for adaptation if the rate of environmental change is fast rather than slow.},

"the most obvious limitation to adapative walk models" (Orr 2005b, p.6): which is that nothing can be said about adaptation from standing genetic variation.

They combine two approaches (adaptive walk and QG) for gradually changing environment to get distribution for adapative substitutions from standing genetic variation as a function of pop size, selection coeff, and rate of environmental change (see eq. 21-25). 

Adaptive-walk models consider adaptation from the successive fixation of de novo mutations only, quantitative genetic models assume that adaptation proceeds exclusively from preexisting standing genetic variation, are the two main approaches to modeling adaptation. The latter approach, however, has focused on short-term evolution of population means and variances rather than on the statistical properties of adaptive substitutions. 

Specifically, we consider the evolution of a quantitative trait to a gradually changing environment. By means of analytical approximations, we derive the distribution of adaptive substitutions from standing genetic variation, that is, the distribution of the phenotypic effects of those alleles from the standing variation that become fixed during adaptation. 

Our results are checked against individual-based simulations. We find that, compared to adaptation from de novo mutations, (i) adaptation from standing variation proceeds by the fixation of more alleles of small effect and (ii) populations that adapt from standing genetic variation can traverse larger distances in phenotype space and, thus, have a higher potential for adaptation if the rate of environmental change is fast rather than slow.

Question: Standing genetic variation is created by de novo mutations, but what portion of de novo mutations make it into standing genetic variation?}

  Abstract                 = {Common principal components (CPC) analysis is a technique for assessing whether variance-covariance matrices from different populations have similar structure. One potential application is to compare additive genetic variance-covariance matrices, G. In this article, the conditions under which G matrices are expected to have common PCs are derived for a two-locus, two-allele model and the model of constrained pleiotropy. The theory demonstrates that whether G matrices are expected to have common PCs is largely determined by whether pleiotropic effects have a modular organization. If two (or more) populations have modules and these modules have the same direction, the G matrices have a common PC, regardless of allele frequencies. In the absence of modules, common PCs exist only for very restricted combinations of allele frequencies. Together, these two results imply that, when populations are evolving, common PCs are expected only when the populations have modules in common. These results have two implications: (1) In general, G matrices will not have common PCs, and (2) when they do, these PCs indicate common modular organization. The interpretation of common PCs identified for estimates of G matrices is discussed in light of these results.},

  Abstract                 = {The methods of quantitative genetics may be useful for quantifying constraints on the rate and direction of response to selection in natural plant populations. We review the assumptions necessary for accurate estimation and significance testing of quantitative-genetic parameters, and consider when such estimates may accurately predict a response to selection. Estimates of heritabilities and genetic correlations can provide good predictions of a long-term response to selection if (1) such estimates are reasonably accurate; (2) many genes contribute to genetic variances and covariances; (3) genetic variance-covariance matrices remain approximately constant through time (when major genes are important sources of variation, when selection is strong, or when populations are small, then rapid alterations in gene frequencies may occur, with consequent changes in the quantitative-genetic parameters); (4) genotype-environment interaction does not alter genetic parameters in new or unmeasured environments; and (5) populations are not inbred. The importance of these assumptions depends on the evolutionary scale of the questions we wish to ask. We discuss evolutionary interpretations of heritabilities and genetic correlations, emphasizing that the plasticity of quantitative-genetic parameters and the imprecision of their estimates are serious problems in the study of natural plant populations. It is important to separate the fundamental, long-term genetic constraints, which limit species evolution, from the transient genetic correlations that may be found in a particular population. It is unclear whether natural populations ever reach equilibrium conditions, in which the additive genetic variance for fitness is depleted. Under many circumstances it is difficult to deduce the past history of selection from the genetic architecture of metrical traits.},

-the relative importance of adaptive evolution, balancing selection, deletirous variation and genetic drift for phenotypic variation within and among populations remains unclear.
-discusses the progress that has been made so far in understanding the evolutionary processes that lead to phenotypic variation

Comments
-evolutionary biologist have sought to understand the evolutionary forces that influence genetic variation within and among natural populations
-theories for explaining segregating variation: mutation-selection balance (deletirious mutations), balancing selection
-Comparison between Drosophila species indicates that 40-95\% of amino-acid replacements might reflect adaptive evolution
-However, the selection coefficients that influence most of these amino-acid changes are low (<1e-4), but adaptive substitutions occur at average of 10-50 years
-Test like "integrated extended haplotype homozygosity" can detect selection, but we still don't know if they can identify the key SNPs responsible for variation
-in populations that are hetergeneously distributed, models predict that low levels of gene flow will cause local adaptation
-def: "rank fitness": is the ordering by fitness of alleles in a particular environment. NOTE: when rank fitness changes among alleles from one environment to the next, polymorphisms can be maintained

conclusion
-However, quantitative genetic and coarse QTL mapping studies are blind to the alleles that underlie complex trait variation. Only when we can recognize frequency and linkage-disequilibrium signatures of deleterious or advantageous polymorphisms as well as heterogeneousorigins of particular phenotypes, and determine allelic history as well as geography, can we infer which evolutionary processes influence the nucleotide polymorphisms that control quantitative-trait variation 4,9,11,23.

These findings are consistent with popular interpretations of Fisher's (1930, 1958) Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection, and Falconer (1960, 1981), but also indicate that high heritabilities are maintained within natural populations even for traits believed to be under strong selection. It is also found that the heritability of morphological traits is significantly lower for ectotherms than it is for endotherms which may in part be a result of the strong correlation between life history and body size for many ectotherms.},

Although evidence for trade-offs is abundant, a surprising number of taxa reveal positive correlations where trade-offs are expected.

* Previous studies suggest two mechanisms to explain the lack of trade-offs in situations where they are predicted by theory: differential resource acquisition and multidimensional trait constraints expressed in the presence of genetic variation. However, there is no direct empirical evidence supporting either hypothesis.

* Using individuals from multiple genotypes of the cyclic parthenogenic freshwater zooplankton, Daphnia pulicaria, we conducted life-history experiments that prevented two key aspects of these mechanisms from operating. The experiments were conducted under a range of resources from levels causing near-starvation to levels of resource abundance yielding a mean clutch size of 4-5eggs. Growth, reproduction and survival were measured for each individual.

* Contrary to expectations, we found strong positive correlations among life-history traits in the absence of both differential resource ingestion, which is one form of differential resource acquisition, and genetic variation. These positive correlations emerge from differential resource utilization, which is one of the steps along the resource ingestion-utilization-allocation pathway.

* Our results demonstrate that strong positive correlations among life-history traits emerge from variation among individuals in an underappreciated aspect of their energy budget. This alternative mechanism has different implications for understanding life-history evolution, and reinforces the potential role that physiological ecology has in shaping life-history trait correlations.},

  Abstract                 = {Pleiotropy is one of the most commonly observed attributes of genes. Yet the extent and influence of pleiotropy have been underexplored in population genetics models. In this paper, I quantify the extent to which pleiotropy inhibits the spread of alleles in response to directional selection on a focal trait. Under the assumption that pleiotropic effects are extensive and deleterious, the fraction of alleles that are beneficial overall is severely limited by pleiotropy and rises nearly linearly with the strength of directional selection on the focal trait. Over a broad class of distribution of pleiotropic effects, the mean selective effect of those alleles that are beneficial overall is halved, on average, by pleiotropy. The fraction of new mutant alleles that are beneficial overall and that succeed in fixing within a population is even more severely limited when directional selection is weak, but it rises quadratically with the strength of directional selection. Finally, the mean selective effect of mutant alleles that are beneficial and succeed in fixing is reduced by one{\textendash}third, on average, by pleiotropy. These results help to shape our understanding of the evolutionary inertia caused by pleiotropy.},

-Quantify the extent to which pleiotropy inhibits the spread of alleles in response to directional selection on a focal trait (assume: pleiotropy effcts extensive & deleterious).

Results
-fraction of alleles that are beneficial overall is severly limited by pleitropy and rises nearly linearly with strength of directional selection on focal trait
-over broad class of distribution of pleiotropic effects, the mean selective effect beneficial alleles is halved on average by pleiotropy
-fraction of new alleles that are beneficial and fix is even more severly limited when directional selection is weak, but rises quadratically with strength of directional selection
-mean selective effect of new alleles that are beneficial and fix is reduced by one third on average by pleiotropy (evolutionary inertia)

-Quote Wright 1968 p.61 "The available evidence indicates that pleitropy is virtually universal"
-selection on focal traits is sum of s_f (direct selection) and s_p (pleiotropic effects, assume s_p < 0) denoted s_t (total selective effect)
-interesting comment: lande & other similar models asses the effects of pleiotropy on the maintenance of genetic variability for a focal trait at mutation-selection balance 
-interesting comment: whether or not mutation-selection balance accounts for observation that quantitative traits often exhibit high heritability, despite strong stabilizing selection, is sensitive to assumptions of model

"other quantitative genetic studies of pleiotropy"
-Hill Keightley 1988; Barton 1990; Kheightley Hill 1990; Kondrashov Turelli - pleiotropy tends to induce stabilizing selection on focal triat due to negative fitness effects of pleiotropy.
-Kill Keightley 1988 - examined the influence of deleterious pleiotropic effects on response to directional selection in quantitative genetics models

Follow-up
-Orr 1998 - resurrection of fisher 1930 model with pleiotropy

Other comments
-some notable math is presented, but might be worth reviewing if only for the benefit of seeing the model used.},

We present an exact solution of the infinite population size limit and provide an estimate of the population size beyond which it is valid. We then discuss approximate approaches to the finite population problem, distinguishing between the case of a single selection coefficient, g(s)=detla(s-s_b), and a continuous distribution of selection coefficients. Analytic estimates for the speed are compared to numerical simulations up to population sizes of order 10^300.},

  Abstract                 = {Models for the evolution of continuously varying traits use heritabilities, genetic correlations, and the G-matrix to quantify the genetic variation upon which selection acts. Given estimates of these parameters, it is possible to predict the long-term effects of selection, infer past selective forces responsible for observed differences between populations or species, and distinguish the effects of drift from selection. Application of these methods, however, requires the unproven assumption that the G-matrix remains constant from one generation to the next. This study examines the assumption of constancy for the wing pattern characteristics of two sibling species of butterflies, Precis coenia and P. evarete (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae). Quantitative genetic parameters were estimated from parent-offspring regression. Two approaches were taken to test the null hypothesis of equality between species. First, pairwise tests between corresponding elements of G and between heritabilities and genetic correlations for the two species were constructed. Second, a modification of Bartlett's modified likelihood-ratio test was used to test for equality between the G-matrices. The matrix test failed to detect any between species differences. In contrast, pairwise comparision revealed significant differences. Thus, it appears that constancy cannot be assumed at the species level in quantitative genetic studies. In particular, the assumption of constancy was violated for the trait with the greatest difference in mean phenotype.},

  Abstract                 = {Genetic exchange in microbes and other facultative sexuals can be rare enough that evolution is almost entirely asexual and populations almost clonal. But the benefits of genetic exchange depend crucially on the diversity of genotypes in a population. How very rare recombination together with the accumulation of new mutations shapes the diversity of large populations and gives rise to faster adaptation is still poorly understood. This paper analyzes a particularly simple model: organisms with two asexual chromosomes that can reassort during rare matings that occur at a rate r. The speed of adaptation for large population sizes N, is found to depend on the ratio log(Nr)/log(N). For larger populations, the needed to yield the same speed decreases as a power of N. Remarkably, the population undergoes spontaneous oscillations alternating between phases when the fittest individuals are created by mutation and when they are created by reassortment, which - in contrast to conventional regimes - decreases the diversity. Between the two phases, the mean fitness jumps rapidly. The oscillatory dynamics and the strong fluctuations this induces have implications for the diversity and coalescent statistics. The results are potentially applicable to large microbial populations, especially viruses that have a small number of chromosomes. Some of the key features may be more broadly applicable for large populations with other types of rare genetic exchange.},

We assayed quantitative genetic variation in a temporary-pond-dwelling population of Daphnia pulex over a full season to examine the role of nonadditive genetic variation and genetic disequilibrium in determining the short-term evolutionary trajectory of a cyclic parthenogen. Quantitative traits were influenced by three factors: (1) clonal selection significantly changed the population mean phenotype during the course of the growing season; (2) sexual reproduction and recombination led to significant changes in life-history trait means and the levels of expressed genetic variation, implying the presence of substantial nonadditive genetic variation and genetic disequilibrium; and (3) Egg-bank effects were found to be an important component of the realized year-to-year change. Additionally, we examined the impact of genetic disequilibria induced by clonal selection on the genetic (co)variance structure with a common principal components model. Clonal selection caused significant changes in the (co)variance structure that were eliminated by a single bout of random mating, suggesting that a build-up of disequilibria was the primary source of changes in the (co)variance structure.

The results from this analysis can be used to visualize the surface implied by a set of selection coefficients. Such a visualization provides a compact summary of selection coefficients, can aid in the comparison of selection surfaces, and can help generate testable hypotheses as to the adaptive significance of the traits under study.

Over the past three decades, characterizing the genes underlying adaptive phenotypic change has revealed many important aspects of evolutionary change. At the same time, natural selection is often fundamentally an ecological process that can often be studied without identifying the genes underlying the variation on which it acts. This duality has given rise to disagreement about whether, and under what circumstances, it is necessary to identify specific genes associated with phenotypic change. This issue is of practical concern, especially for researchers who study nonmodel organisms, because of the often enormous cost and labor required to go for the genes. We here consider a number of situations and questions commonly addressed by researchers. Our conclusion is that although gene identification can be crucial for answering some questions, there are others for which definitive answers can be obtained without finding underlying genes.

The simulated population is finite, and each individual has a finite number of loci. Therefore, selection may cause allele frequencies and distributions to change over time. Since the equation assumes constant genetic parameters, the degree to which such allelic changes affect predictions can be examined. Predictions are based only on information available at generation zero of directional selection. The quality of the predictions depends on the nature of allelic distributions in the original population. If allelic effects are approximately normally distributed, as assumed in Lande's Gaussian approximation to the continuum-of-alleles model, the predictions are very accurate, despite small changes in the G matrix. If allelic effects have a leptokurtic distribution, as is likely in Turelli's house-of-cards approximation, the equation underestimates the rate of response and correlated response, and overestimates the time required for the trait means to reach their equilibrium values. Models with biallelic loci have limits as to the amount of trait divergence possible, since only two allelic values are available at each of a finite set of loci. If the new optimal trait values lie within these limits, predictions are good. if not, singularity in the G matrix results in suboptimal equilibria, despite the presence of genetic variance for each individual trait.},

  Abstract                 = {Theoretical quantitative genetics provides a framework for reconstructing past selection and predicting future patterns of phenotypic differentiation. However, the usefulness of the equations of quantitative genetics for evolutionary inference relies on the evolutionary stability of the additive genetic variance-covariance matrix (G matrix). A fruitful new approach for exploring the evolutionary dynamics of G involves the use of individual-based computer simulations. Previous studies have focused on the evolution of the eigenstructure of G. An alternative approach employed in this paper uses the multivariate response-to-selection equation to evaluate the stability of G. In this approach, I measure similarity by the correlation between response-to-selection vectors due to random selection gradients. I analyze the dynamics of G under several conditions of correlational mutation and selection. As found in a previous study, the eigenstructure of G is stabilized by correlational mutation and selection. However, over broad conditions, instability of G did not result in a decreased consistency of the response to selection. I also analyze the stability of G when the correlation coefficients of correlational mutation and selection and the effective population size change through time. To my knowledge, no prior study has used computer simulations to investigate the stability of G when correlational mutation and selection fluctuate. Under these conditions, the eigenstructure of G is unstable under some simulation conditions. Different results are obtained if G matrix stability is assessed by eigenanalysis or by the response to random selection gradients. In this case, the response to selection is most consistent when certain aspects of the eigenstructure of G are least stable and vice versa.},

Genetic variances and covariances will be reduced by stabilizing selection, directional selection and drift, and increased by mutation. Changes in trait values resulting from directional selection that are comparable with differences observed among species are readily obtainable in short geological time spans (<5000 generations) with selection intensities so small that they would have an insignificant effect on the G matrix (of course it is possible that such changes came about by strong selection over a few generations, followed by long periods of stasis; there is insufficient evidence to presently distinguish these two possibilities).

A few other combinations were investigated, but insufficient data were obtained for separate analysis. A total of 1798 correlations, distributed over 51 different animal and plant species, were analyzed. The analysis was conducted at two levels: first by dividing the data set solely by trait combination, and second by blocking the data by trait combination and species. Because selection will tend to fix alleles that show positive correlations with fitness traits faster than those that are negative and because the latter are expected to arise more frequently by mutation, correlations between life-history traits are predicted to be more often negative than those between morphological traits. This prediction was supported, with the ranking in decreasing proportion of negative correlations being: L x L > L x M > B x B > M x M. The mean magnitude of the genetic correlation shows little variation among morphological and life-history combinations, and the distribution of values is remarkably flat. However, the estimated standard errors and the coefficient of variation (SE/rG) are large, making it difficult to separate biological factors influencing the pattern of dispersion from experimental error. Analysis of the phenotypic and genetic correlations suggest that for the combinations M x M and L x M, but not L x L or B x B, the phenotypic correlation is an adequate estimate of the genetic correlation.},

In the present paper, we identify four topics of key importance for studies of the evolutionary biology of trade-offs. First, we consider the underlying concept of constraint'. We conclude that this term is typically used too vaguely and suggest that constraint' in the sense of a bias should be clearly distinguished from constraint' in the sense of proscribed combinations of traits or evolutionary trajectories. Secondly, we address the utility of the acquisition-allocation model (the Y-model'). We find that, whereas this model and its derivatives have provided new insights, a misunderstanding of the pivotal equation has led to incorrect predictions and faulty tests. Thirdly, we ask how trade-offs are expected to evolve under directional selection. A quantitative genetic model predicts that, under weak or short-term selection, the intercept will change but the slope will remain constant. Two empirical tests support this prediction but these are based on comparisons of geographic populations: more direct tests will come from artificial selection experiments. Finally, we discuss what maintains variation in trade-offs noting that at present little attention has been given to this question. We distinguish between phenotypic and genetic variation and suggest that the latter is most in need of explanation. We suggest that four factors deserving investigation are mutation-selection balance, antagonistic pleiotropy, correlational selection and spatio-temporal variation, but as in the other areas of research on trade-offs, empirical generalizations are impeded by lack of data. Although this lack is discouraging, we suggest that it provides a rich ground for further study and the integration of many disciplines, including the emerging field of genomics.},

-Main objective of the paper is to discuss how trade-offs evolve by reviewing four topics:
1) problems with the concept of constraint
2) insights from models of resource acquisition-allocation
3) the effect of directional selection on statistical description of trade-offs **
4) what maintains variation in the trade-off ***

PAPER RELAVANT COMMENTS
-Evolutionary biological thought firmly grounded on assumption that trait evolution is restricted or biased by fitness trade-offs (1)
-The existance of fitness trade-offs and their central place in shaping evolutionary trajectories is not doubted, but we lack an understanding (theor/empir) of how they evolve (3)
-Use of the word 'constraint' (effects of neg. genetic correlations) has two meanings, used in sense of: 1) impeding but not stopping evolution, 2) evolutionary trajectories unavailable to selection due to constraints
*Constraints in the sense of (2) require showing eval in some direction is zero, which is statistically hard (if not impossible) to show.
-Trade-offs are specified in QG by neg. covariance between traits, possibly caused by pleiotropy or LD 
-Problems such as "the problem of dimensionality" make it necessary to consider quantitative genetic analysis with phenotypic analysis focusing on underlying functional relationship.

-Section "expanding scope of Y-model" gives decomposition of variance between two traits as you derived in your model (read this section for additional conclusions)

In this paper we examine the stability of the genetic architecture of two traits known to be subject to natural selection; femur length and ovipositor length in two species of the cricket Allonemobius. 

Previous studies have shown that in A. fasciatus and A. socius natural selection favours an increased body size southwards but a decreased ovipositor length. Such countergradient selection should tend to favour a change in G. In the total sample of eight populations of A. socius and one of A. fasciatus we show that there is significant variation in all genetic covariance components, i.e. VA for body size, VA for ovipositor length, and CovA. This variation results entirely from an increase in the covariances of A. fasciatus.

although larger, these components are approximately proportionally increased, thereby leading to no statistically significant change in the genetic correlation. 

A proportional increase in the covariance components is consistent with changes resulting from genetic drift. On the other hand, the genetic covariance components are significantly correlated with the length of the growing season suggesting that the change in the genetic architecture is the result of selection and drift.

\cite{roff1999does} stated that long-term prediction of the evolution of quantitative traits is a problem because it requires genetic parameters to remain constant (i.e. constant \G matrix). He mentions that the proposition is often justified by assuming that selection is too weak to significantly erode additive genetic variances as they are restored by mutations (cites Lande 1976, 1979). Lande's justification in the 1976 paper makes the observation that in directional selection experiments on quantitative characters, $h^2$ and $\sigma^2$ remain constant even after the mean has changed a substantial amount of standard deviations (Mather and Harrison, 1949; Winter, 1929; Robertson and Reeve, 1952), so that for weaker selection typical in natural populations, an equilibrium amount of heritable variation is can be maintained by the accumulation of mutations; the weak selection assumption is not always valid (Ender 1986). \cite{roff1999does} notes that there is no theoretical justification for constant genetic architecture (turelli 1988, arnold 1992), and the question must be addressed empirically, which is what he aims to do in the remainder of the paper.}

  Abstract                 = {Using a previously undescribed approach, we develop an analytic model that predicts whether an asexual population accumulates advantageous or deleterious mutations over time and the rate at which either process occurs. The model considers a large number of linked identical loci, or nucleotide sites; assumes that the selection coefficient per site is much less than the mutation rate per genome; and includes back and compensating mutations. Using analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate the accuracy of our results over almost the entire range of population sizes. Two limiting cases of our results, when either deleterious or advantageous mutations can be neglected, correspond to the Fisher-Muller effect and Muller's ratchet, respectively. By comparing predictions of our model (no recombination) to those of simple single-locus models (strong recombination), we show that the accumulation of advantageous mutations is slowed by linkage over a broad, finite range of population size. This supports the view of Fisher and Muller, who argued in the 1930s that progressive evolution of organisms is slowed because loci at which beneficial mutations can occur are often linked together on the same chromosome. These results follow from our main finding, that distribution of sequences over the mutation number evolves as a traveling wave whose speed and width depend on population size and other parameters. The model explains a logarithmic dependence of steady-state fitness on the population size reported recently for an RNA virus.},

Here we investigate the importance of pleiotropy and epistasis in determining the adaptive value of a candidate gene using the gene FRI (FRIGIDA), which is thought to be the major gene controlling flowering time variation in Arabidopsis thaliana. The effect of FRI on flowering time was analyzed in an outbred population created by randomly mating 19 natural accessions of A. thaliana. This unique population allows the estimation of FRI effects independent of any linkage association with other loci due to demographic processes or to coadapted genes. It also allows for the estimation of pleiotropic effects of FRI on fitness and inflorescence architecture. We found that FRI explains less variation in flowering time than previously observed among natural accessions, and interacts epistatically with the FLC locus. Although early flowering plants produce more fruits under spring conditions, and nonfunctional alleles of FRI were associated with early flowering, variation at FRI was not associated with fitness. We show that nonfunctional FRI alleles have negative pleiotropic effects on fitness by reducing the numbers of nodes and branches on the inflorescence. We propose that these antagonistic pleiotropic effects reduce the adaptive value of FRI, and helps explain the maintenance of alternative life history strategies across natural populations of A. thaliana.},

CHAPTER 9 "DIVERGENCE ALONG GENETIC LINES OF LEAST RESISTANCE"
Applies the quantitative genetics framework - infinitesimal model to examine 

The use of gmax to describe the population's evolution on the adaptive landscape is dependent on the assumption that the direction of divergent natural selection is random with respect to gmax. If not, then other interpretations are possible (discussed in Schluter 1996: gmax determined by natural selection and hence aligned with beta - direction of divergence)

the section on host shifts in leaf beetles talks about Futuyma et al 1995, which tested whether genetic variance in host biased realized host shifts. Expectation was that history of host transition in ophraella should be reflected in amounts of expressed genetic variance in feeding traits immediately after new host colonized. More variance give higher success for transition to be likely. Prediction was that beetles transplanted to the host of closely related ophraella species would more often exhibit genetic variance in leaf consumption rate than beetles transplanted to the host of a distantly related species. This was a test for genetic constraints.

The section on retrospective selection deals with a subset of galapagos finches. Using lande's equation, they show that selection on beak shape is perhaps most responsible for the differences in these birds. The use of lande's equation requires a constant G and other assumptions that follow, but the simple example highlights the use of lande's equation for retrospective selection.

See Mitchell Olds 1996 for discussion of applying the infinitesimal model to life history traits and its significance to macroevolution.
See Houle 1992 for discussion on genetic variance in life history traits being comparable to those of morphological traits. They have lower h^2, but are not less evolvable, only have higher environmental component of variance.
See Roff 1997 for dicusssion on ubiquitous nature of genetic correlations

"The predominant cause of genetic covariance is pleiotropy, in which allelic variation at a locus influences more than one trait. Linkage disequilibrium (nonrandom assortment of alleles at different loci) is a secondary cause of genetic covariance except in unusual cases." P.218

KEYWORDS: Adaptive radiations, G-matrix, Adaptive divergence, 

DATA: Two species of threespine stickleback considered (Enos lake limnetic and Benthos species). Original data on threespine sticklebacks, together with published genetic measurements from other vertebrates, show that morphological differentiation between species has been biased in the direction of gmax for at least four million years, despite evidence that natural selection is the cause of differentiation. Other species: Galapagos medium ground finch, song sparrow, collard flycatcher, and peromyscus mice.

FIRST TEST: This bias toward the direction of evolution tends to decay with time. 
FINDING: This is confirmed in the section of over all trends and shown in figure 2 which shows that the smaller genetic distance is associated with a smaller angle theta.

SECOND TEST: Rate of morphological divergence between species is inversely proportional to "theta", the angle between the direction of divergence and the direction of greatest genetic variation. 
FINDING: Figure 3 confirms these results. Smaller rate of divergence (change in mean) are associated with larger theta.

THIRD TEST: If direction of selection is very distinct from gmax, then progress towards fitness peak will be relatively slower.
FINDING: Figure 3 confirms this, i.e. the mean changes less and less the direction of selection becomes orthogonal to gmax.

FOURTH TEST: The direction of greatest phenotypic variance is not identical with gmax, but for these data is nearly as successful at predicting the direction of species divergence. 
FINDING: the different data sets gave distinct results in the comparisons between gmax and pmax (see last paragraph before discussion)

I interpret the findings to mean that genetic variances and covariances constrain adaptive change in quantitative traits for reasonably long spans of time. 

An alternative hypothesis, however, cannot be ruled out: that morphological differentiation is biased in the direction gmax because divergence and gmax are both shaped by the same natural selection pressures. Either way, the results reveal that adaptive differentiation occurs principally along "genetic lines of least resistance."

OTHER NOTABLE POINTS:
None of the genetic models concerning heritable variation guarantee constancy of G. Issue must be addressed empirically (Turelli 1988, Barton Turelli 1989)

The comparisons revealed highly significant differences in G between the Base population and the population selected for small thorax ("Small") and also between the Base and Control populations (tables 1, 2). The G matrices of the populations selected for large and small thorax were also significantly different. In contrast, the G matrix of Large did not differ significantly (P > 0.15) from those of either the Base or Control populations, nor did the G matrix of Small differ significantly from that of Control.

Statistically significant differences among the G matrices of their four populations (agrees with Wilkinson's results). significant differences in G between Base population and one selected for small thorax ("Small"). Significant differences in G between Base and Control populations. The G matrices of the populations selected for large and small thorax were also significantly different. Insignificant G differences (in contrast to Wilkinson's results). G matrix of Large did not differ significantly (P > 0.15) from Base or Control populations. G matrix of Small also did not differ significantly from that of Control.

SHAW'S ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS OF RESULTS
Changes in G possibly due to drift. Although selection may have played a role in producing these differences, their magnitude and direction seem consistent with the effects of genetic drift.

DRIFT EXPLANATION: 
small size of selected and Control populations makes genetic drift plausible alternative. Supported by highly statistically significant difference between G's of Base and Control populations. Basic drift calculation indicates a 23\% reduction in additive variance from drift. Qualitative conclusion is that although selection may have altered G, but observed reduction in vars compatible with expectations from drift alone. 

CHANGES IN G DUE TO BULMER EFFECT
Even when estimated G's are precisely constant, retrospective selection analyses may be misleading because of unobserved transient changes in G produced by periods of intense selection (Bulmer 1980).

BULMER EFFECT: selection induced changes in G confound effects and results from retrospective selection analysis. They use a two trait simple model to compare the retrospective selection, with actual selection after accounting for the Bulmer effect using eqtn (5).},

  Abstract                 = {A statistical method for comparing matrices of genetic variation and covariation between groups (e.g., species, populations, a single population grown in distinct environments) is proposed. This maximum-likelihood method provides a test of the overall null hypothesis that two covariance component matrices are identical. Moreover, when the overall null hypothesis is rejected, the method provides a framework for isolating the particular components that differ significantly between the groups. Simulation studies reveal that discouragingly large experiments are necessary to obtain acceptable power for comparing genetic covariance component matrices. For example, even in cases of a single trait measured on 900 individuals in a nested design of 100 sires and three dams per sire in each population, the power was only about 0.5 when additive genetic variance differed by a factor of 2.5. Nevertheless, this flexible method makes valid comparison of covariance component matrices possible.},

  Abstract                 = {Human genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are revealing the genetic architecture of anthropomorphic and biomedical traits, i.e., the frequencies and effect sizes of variants that contribute to heritable variation in a trait. To interpret these findings, we need to understand how genetic architecture is shaped by basic population genetics processes-notably, by mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift. Because many quantitative traits are subject to stabilizing selection and because genetic variation that affects one trait often affects many others, we model the genetic architecture of a focal trait that arises under stabilizing selection in a multidimensional trait space. We solve the model for the phenotypic distribution and allelic dynamics at steady state and derive robust, closed-form solutions for summary statistics of the genetic architecture. Our results provide a simple interpretation for missing heritability and why it varies among traits. They predict that the distribution of variances contributed by loci identified in GWASs is well approximated by a simple functional form that depends on a single parameter: the expected contribution to genetic variance of a strongly selected site affecting the trait. We test this prediction against the results of GWASs for height and body mass index (BMI) and find that it fits the data well, allowing us to make inferences about the degree of pleiotropy and mutational target size for these traits. Our findings help to explain why the GWAS for height explains more of the heritable variance than the similarly sized GWAS for BMI and to predict the increase in explained heritability with study sample size. Considering the demographic history of European populations, in which these GWASs were performed, we further find that most of the associations they identified likely involve mutations that arose shortly before or during the Out-of-Africa bottleneck at sites with selection coefficients around s = 10^-3.},

  Abstract                 = {We review and discuss the importance of correlational selection (selection for optimal character combinations) in natural populations. If two or more traits subject to multivariate selection are heritable, correlational selection builds favourable genetic correlations through the formation of linkage disequilibrium at underlying loci governing the traits. However, linkage disequilibria built up by correlational selection are expected to decay rapidly (ie, within a few generations), unless correlational selection is strong and chronic. We argue that frequency-dependent biotic interactions that have 'Red Queen dynamics' (eg, host-parasite interactions, predator-prey relationships or intraspecific arms races) often fuel chronic correlational selection, which is strong enough to maintain adaptive genetic correlations of the kind we describe. We illustrate these processes and phenomena using empirical examples from various plant and animal systems, including our own recent work on the evolutionary dynamics of a heritable throat colour polymorphism in the side-blotched lizard Uta stansburiana. In particular, male and female colour morphs of side-blotched lizards cycle on five- and two-generation (year) timescales under the force of strong frequency-dependent selection. Each morph refines the other morph in a Red Queen dynamic. Strong correlational selection gradients among life history, immunological and morphological traits shape the genetic correlations of the side-blotched lizard polymorphism. We discuss the broader evolutionary consequences of the buildup of co-adapted trait complexes within species, such as the implications for speciation processes.},

  Abstract                 = {The genetic variance-covariance matrix (G) is a quantity of central importance in evolutionary biology due to its influence on the rate and direction of multivariate evolution. However, the predictive power of empirically estimated G-matrices is limited for two reasons. First, phenotypes are high-dimensional, whereas traditional statistical methods are tuned to estimate and analyse low-dimensional matrices. Second, the stability of G to environmental effects and over time remains poorly understood. Using Bayesian sparse factor analysis (BSFG) designed to estimate high-dimensional G-matrices, we analysed levels variation and covariation in 10,527 expressed genes in a large (n=563) half-sib breeding design of three-spined sticklebacks subject to two temperature treatments. We found significant differences in the structure of G between the treatments: heritabilities and evolvabilities were higher in the warm than in the low-temperature treatment, suggesting more and faster opportunity to evolve in warm (stressful) conditions. Furthermore, comparison of G and its phenotypic equivalent P revealed the latter is a poor substitute of the former. Most strikingly, the results suggest that the expected impact of G on evolvabilityas well as the similarity among G-matricesmay depend strongly on the number of traits included into analyses. In our results, the inclusion of only few traits in the analyses leads to underestimation in the differences between the G-matrices and their predicted impacts on evolution. While the results highlight the challenges involved in estimating G, they also illustrate that by enabling the estimation of large G-matrices, the BSFG method can improve predicted evolutionary responses to selection.},

First, much of the additive variation in gene expression data sets might be confined by relatively few latent factors, indicating that the low dimensionality transcriptional variability may pose severe constraints to evolution. 

Second, the levels and patterns of genetic variation and covariation can change markedly in response to different environmental conditions, making evolutionary trajectories unpredictable on timescales as short as two generations. 

Third, the phenotypic and genetic variance-covariance matrices can be dissimilar, and hence, P can be a poor substitute for G for predicting evolutionary transitions. 

Fourth and most importantly, the number of traits included into study (i.e., matrix dimensionality) may influence the inference about expected evolutionary responses: studies utilizing small G-matrices (<20 traits) to make predictions about evolutionary trajectories may underestimate evolutionary constrains caused by genetic correlations.},

Lande or the house-of-cards model introduced in 1985 by M. Turelli can be regarded as typical of models that are intermediate between them. We found that, under stabilizing selection, the variance of one character at equilibrium may depend on the strength of stabilizing selection on the other character (as in the house-of-cards model) or not (as in the multivariate normal model) depending on the types of mutations that can occur. Similarly, under directional selection, the genetic covariance between two characters may increase substantially (as in the house-of-cards model) or not (as in the multivariate normal model) depending on the kinds of mutations that are assumed to occur. Hence, even for the simple model we consider, neither the house-of-cards nor the multivariate normal model can be used to make predictions, making it unlikely that either could be used to draw general conclusions about more complex and realistic models.},

Newer models allow for the possibility that beneficial mutations are sufficiently common to coexist and compete for fixation within populations. Experimental evolution studies in microbes provide empirical support for stochastic models in which both selection and mutation are strong effects and clones compete for fixation; however, the relative importance of competition among clones bearing mutations of different selective effects versus competition among clones bearing multiple mutations remains unresolved. We provide some new theoretical results, moreover, suggesting that population dynamics consistent with the periodic selection model can arise even in a deterministic model that can accommodate a very high beneficial mutation rate. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society},

-find many life history traits are maintained well within the limits imposed by history and design, i.e. we don't get the extreme versions of traits that would result from selection (no citation)
-trade-offs have been measured through field observations, through experimental manipulations in laboratory and field, through phenotypic correlations in laboratory and through genetic correlations
-most prominent life history trade off involves cost of reproduction: williams - genetic costs from antagonistic pleiotropy and negative phenotypic costs represented by negative correlations
-distinction made between intragenerational trade offs and intraindividual trade offs
-at time of publication, no known way to use current genetic structure of population to infer tradeoffs that constrained past approach to current state
-trade-offs at phenotypic level: whole organism measurements on traits directly connected to reproduction and survival
-trade-offs at genotypic level: all types of evidence claimed to be genetic (QG, mendelian, molecular genetics)

-2 important cases to consider
(1) negative genetic correlations exists in a growing population, but most phenotypic variation is environmentally induced in traits, and so no trait correlations appear
(2) two phenotypic traits can be strongly negatively correlated, without any genetic basis, and selection pressure may exist but no evolutionary response is possible

-people have tried to measure genetic correlations with mixed results
(1) measurements made with breeding designs (full/half sib), have found positive, negative and insifnificant correlations (harder to deal with sampling problems addressed with family size)
(2) measurements of indirect selection on one trait correlated to another reveal mostly negative correlations (large number of these experiments more consistent)

-selection experiments are best suited to measure genetic correlations, but they need to be carried out in more environmental conditions to 
-clutch size vs other life histroy traits are often studied for trade offs
-hormones affect many processes simultaneously and create patterns of correlation among responses
-antagonistic pleiotropy in the evolution of senscence - female hormones promote reproduction in early life, but involve disturbances to calcium metabolism in later life
-endocrine system mediated genetic correlations need to be examined more in research
-example of positive correlation observed in measurements of individuals for allocation of energy between reproduction and survival
-life history theory predicts that life history traits should be negatively correlated (see olijnyk nelson for references)
-genetic covariance sensitive to changes in gene frequencies and substitution of genes, so caution must be taken when claiming that negative correlations have relavence to historical path leading to current state
-2 questions: what constrains evolution (trade-offs relevant), and what produced patterns we see today?

  Abstract                 = {Do size and phylogeny affect patterns of covariation in life-history traits? If there are phylogenetic constraints on the evolution of life histories, do they differ from lineage to lineage? I applied principal component analysis and cluster analysis to two data sets - 65 mammal species (14 orders, 30 families, 10 traits) and 162 mammal species (22 orders, 64 families, 6 traits). In both data sets, most of the covariation in life-history traits could be accounted for by the first two factors, and in both data sets their interpretation was similar. The first factor, accounting for 68-75\% of covariation of life-history traits, ranked the animals from early maturing, small, short-lived animals with short gestation periods, many small altricial young, and long lactation periods, to the opposite suite of traits in large animals. The second factor, accounting for 12-20\% of the covariation in life-history traits, ranked the animals from altricial to precocial. When order and family effects were removed, the proportion of variance accounted for by the first factor dropped 29-36\%, and the number of high-level clusters increased. Analysis within individual families revealed differences from lineage to lineage in the loadings of each trait on the first two principle factors. Weight alone accounts for much of the tendency for mammals to be arranged on a single axis ranging from early maturing, highly fecund, and short-lived small animals to the opposite. However, after the effects of weight were removed, order and family effects still had significant impact on patterns of covariation. Thus morphological design, in addition to size, may constrain life-history evolution. This explains why earlier workers saw clear patterns of covariation at high taxonomic levels whereas subsequent workers have found less covariation within species. /// &#x412;&#x43b;&#x438;&#x44f;&#x44e;&#x442;

  Abstract                 = {A modified minimum evolution approach is used to estimate covariance matrices for hypothetical ancestors. Branch lengths are calculated as the mean disparity in corresponding ancestor-descendent covariances. Branches are longest leading to terminal populations and subspecies, while interspecific branches are relatively short, indicating a general conservation of covariance structure among species despite a high degree of intraspecific variability. Absolute deviations in covariance structure are not correlated with phenotypic divergence. Interpreted in light of other studies, the analyses suggest that deviations in covariance structure are most strongly associated with the formation of diagnosably distinct taxa and stochastic sampling of genotypes at the population level. There is no evidence for restructuring of phenotypic covariance structure in association with reproductive isolation. The results suggest that phenotypic covariances are dynamic over short time scales and do not support attempts to extrapolate genetic covariance structure to explain or predict macroevolutionary change. This study further demonstrates that branch lengths, which are not usually analyzed in detail, contain valuable evolutionary information complementary to that residing in the branching pattern.},

That assumption is tested among 28 populations of the Phyllotis darwini species group (leaf-eared mice). Phenotypic covariances are used as a surrogate for genetic covariances to allow much greater phylogenetic sampling. Two new approaches are applied that extend the comparative method to multivariate data. The efficacy of these techniques are compared, and their sensitivity to sampling error examined. Pairwise matrix correlations of correlation matrices are consistently very high (> 0.90) and show no significant association between matrix similarity and phylogenetic relatedness. Hierarchical decomposition of common principal component (CPC) analyses applied to each clade in the phylogeny rejects the hypothesis that common principal component structure is shared in clades more inclusive than subspecies. Most subspecies also lack a common covariance structure as described by the CPC model. The hypothesis of constant covariances must be rejected, but the magnitudes of divergence in covariance structure appear to be small. Matrix correlations are very sensitive to sampling error, while CPC is not. CPC is a powerful statistical tool that allows detailed testing of underlying patterns of covariation.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the oldest problems in evolutionary biology remains largely unsolved. Which mutations generate evolutionarily relevant phenotypic variation? What kinds of molecular changes do they entail? What are the phenotypic magnitudes, frequencies of origin, and pleiotropic effects of such mutations? How is the genome constructed to allow the observed abundance of phenotypic diversity? Historically, the neo-Darwinian synthesizers stressed the predominance of micromutations in evolution, whereas others noted the similarities between some dramatic mutations and evolutionary transitions to argue for macromutationism. Arguments on both sides have been biased by misconceptions of the developmental effects of mutations. For example, the traditional view that mutations of important developmental genes always have large pleiotropic effects can now be seen to be a conclusion drawn from observations of a small class of mutations with dramatic effects. It is possible that some mutations, for example, those in cis-regulatory DNA, have few or no pleiotropic effects and may be the predominant source of morphological evolution. In contrast, mutations causing dramatic phenotypic effects, although superficially similar to hypothesized evolutionary transitions, are unlikely to fairly represent the true path of evolution. Recent developmental studies of gene function provide a new way of conceptualizing and studying variation that contrasts with the traditional genetic view that was incorporated into neo-Darwinian theory and population genetics. This new approach in developmental biology is as important for microevolutionary studies as the actual results from recent evolutionary developmental studies. In particular, this approach will assist in the task of identifying the specific mutations generating phenotypic variation and elucidating how they alter gene function. These data will provide the current missing link between molecular and phenotypic variation in natural populations.},

  Abstract                 = {The rediscovery of Mendel's laws a century ago launched the science that William Bateson called ``genetics,'' and led to a new view of evolution combining selection, particulate inheritance, and the newly characterized phenomenon of ``mutation.'' This ``mutationist'' view clashed with the earlier view of Darwin, and the later ``Modern Synthesis,'' by allowing discontinuity, and by recognizing mutation (or more properly, mutation-and-altered-development) as a source of creativity, direction, and initiative. By the mid-20th century, the opposing Modern Synthesis view was a prevailing orthodoxy: under its influence, ``evolution'' was redefined as ``shifting gene frequencies,'' that is, the sorting out of pre-existing variation without new mutations; and the notion that mutation-and-altered-development can exert a predictable influence on the course of evolutionary change was seen as heretical. Nevertheless, mutationist ideas re-surfaced: the notion of mutational determinants of directionality emerged in molecular evolution by 1962, followed in the 1980s by an interest among evolutionary developmental biologists in a shaping or creative role of developmental propensities of variation, and more recently, a recognition by theoretical evolutionary geneticists of the importance of discontinuity and of new mutations in adaptive dynamics. The synthetic challenge presented by these innovations is to integrate mutation-and-altered-development into a new understanding of the dual causation of evolutionary change-a broader and more predictive understanding that already can lay claim to important empirical and theoretical results-and to develop a research program appropriately emphasizing the emergence of variation as a cause of propensities of evolutionary change.},

Here we analysed 264 complete genomes from 12 Escherichia coli populations to characterize their dynamics over 50,000 generations. The populations that retained the ancestral mutation rate support a model in which most fixed mutations are beneficial, the fraction of beneficial mutations declines as fitness rises, and neutral mutations accumulate at a constant rate. We also compared these populations to mutation-accumulation lines evolved under a bottlenecking regime that minimizes selection. Nonsynonymous mutations, intergenic mutations, insertions and deletions are overrepresented in the long-term populations, further supporting the inference that most mutations that reached high frequency were favoured by selection. These results illuminate the shifting balance of forces that govern genome evolution in populations adapting to a new environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Migration is a complex trait although little is known about genetic correlations between traits involved in such migration syndromes. To assess the migratory responses to climate change, we need information on genetic constraints on evolutionary potential of arrival dates in migratory birds. Using two long-term data sets on barn swallows Hirundo rustica (from Spain and Denmark), we show for the first time in wild populations that spring arrival dates are phenotypically and genetically correlated with morphological and life history traits. In the Danish population, length of outermost tail feathers and wing length were negatively genetically correlated with arrival date. In the Spanish population, we found a negative genetic correlation between arrival date and time elapsed between arrival date and laying date, constraining response to selection that favours both early arrival and shorter delays. This results in a decreased rate of adaptation, not because of constraints on arrival date, but constraints on delay before breeding, that is, a trait that can be equally important in the context of climate change.},

We assess the migratory responses to climate change, using information on genetic constraints on evolutionary potential of arrival dates in migratory birds based on two long-term data sets on barn swallows Hirundo rustica (from Spain and Denmark).

we show for the first time in wild populations that spring arrival dates are phenotypically and genetically correlated with morphological and life history traits. 

In the Danish population, length of outermost tail feathers and wing length were negatively genetically correlated with arrival date. In the Spanish population, we found a negative genetic correlation between arrival date and time elapsed between arrival date and laying date, constraining response to selection that favours both early arrival and shorter delays. 

This results in a decreased rate of adaptation, not because of constraints on arrival date, but constraints on delay before breeding, that is, a trait that can be equally important in the context of climate change.}

  Abstract                 = {Background

In a rapidly changing world, it is of fundamental importance to understand processes constraining or facilitating adaptation through microevolution. As different traits of an organism covary, genetic correlations are expected to affect evolutionary trajectories. However, only limited empirical data are available.

Methodology/Principal Findings

We investigate the extent to which multivariate constraints affect the rate of adaptation, focusing on four morphological traits often shown to harbour large amounts of genetic variance and considered to be subject to limited evolutionary constraints. Our data set includes unique long-term data for seven bird species and a total of 10 populations. We estimate population-specific matrices of genetic correlations and multivariate selection coefficients to predict evolutionary responses to selection. Using Bayesian methods that facilitate the propagation of errors in estimates, we compare (1) the rate of adaptation based on predicted response to selection when including genetic correlations with predictions from models where these genetic correlations were set to zero and (2) the multivariate evolvability in the direction of current selection to the average evolvability in random directions of the phenotypic space. We show that genetic correlations on average decrease the predicted rate of adaptation by 28\%. Multivariate evolvability in the direction of current selection was systematically lower than average evolvability in random directions of space. These significant reductions in the rate of adaptation and reduced evolvability were due to a general nonalignment of selection and genetic variance, notably orthogonality of directional selection with the size axis along which most (60\%) of the genetic variance is found.

Conclusions

These results suggest that genetic correlations can impose significant constraints on the evolution of avian morphology in wild populations. This could have important impacts on evolutionary dynamics and hence population persistence in the face of rapid environmental},

TURELLI 1988 - PHONOTYPIC EVOLUTION CONSTANT COVARIANCE AND THE MAINTENANCE OF ADDITIVE VARIANCE
MAIN POINTS/TOPICS OF DISCUSSION
phenotypic evolution (including speciation), and the maintenance of heritable variation are the two key problems in evolutionary QG, but the two are decoupled in practice! Why? Bridge between them concerns whether explicit genetic models can predict variances and covariances that enter phenotypic models as parameters. Answer = NO! No theoretical analysis can ensure that points below can be met, thus constancy of G must be determined empirically. G X E interactions can change var-covs even without genetic change (Service & Rose 1985), or can change without them. For constant G, genetic models must assume environment doesn't change E or G directly.
TURELLI'S OBJECTIVES: 
Consider three models that make progressively less stringent assumptions about polygenic variation and examine conditions for constant G. Clarify implications of different genetic assumptions

STUDIES/LITERATURE ON RELATED TOPICS
Maintenance of variation through mutation-stabilizing selection balance: Lande, 1975, 1977, 1980b
Retrospective selection studies, assuming constancy of G: Lande, 1979; Price et al., 1984; Schluter, 1984; Price and Grant, 1985; Lofsvold, 1986, 1988

OTHER NOTABLE POINTS:
Other mechanisms of maintaining variance: pleiotropic overdominance, frequency dependent selection, variation in fitness over space and time.

BULMER'S INFINITESIMAL MODEL: 
most conducive to constant genetic parameters. Bulmer showed that additive variance of a single character do not depend only on the current additive variance (expressed in the parent-offspring regression eqtn 1). The variance dynamics also depend on amount of additive variance that current allele frequencies produce in linkage equilibrium . Changes in follow equation (6), from Bulmer's 1980 work. Even in idealized genetic model, evolution of phenotypic means will be accompanied by genetically induced changes in genetic covariances unless the shape of the multivariate fitness function remains constant.

LANDE'S GAUSSIAN ALLELIC MODEL 
is based on unproven biological assumptions concerning 1) the relative magnitude of mutation and selection parameters and 2) the number of alleles segregating at each locus, and some of this model's quantitative and qualitative implications are not robust (Turelli, 1984,1985,1988). Constancy of G requires additional biological assumptions besides those needed to justify the basic model (Lande's Gaussian allelic model). Allelic variation maintained by mutation-selection balance. Assumes that allelic effects are additive within and between loci and that the joint distribution of effects across loci is multivariate Gaussian (Lande, 1975, 1980b). Under all mutation-selection models, constancy of with a shift in the mean requires at least three things (see eqtn 10); (i) New environment must not change G directly, (ii) shape of fitness surface must remained fixed as the phenotypic optimum changes, (iii) Covariances from new mutations in must also remain constant.

MODEL WITH NON-GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION OF ALLELIC EFFECTS
(Barton & Turelli 1987, Turelli 1988, Bulmer 1980 Ch.10, Crow Kimura 1970 Ch.5)
For one character changes in mean generally accompanied by chances in variance if distribution of allelic effects not gaussian, regardless of the mechanism maintaining variation. 
Turelli 1988 extended this work to two pleiotropically connected characters (i.e. controlled by some of the same genes?) and showed that changes in mean of one, will cause changes in variance of another, even if characters are genetically uncorrelated, i.e in mut-sel balance models, changes in mean will cause changes in variances and covariances.

TURELLI'S CONCLUSIONS: 
In long run, cannot make robust predictions about the dynamics of covariances caused by the evolution of genotype frequencies. 
G-matrices should still be viewed as local descriptions of underlying genetic structure, but G will change as means evolve.},

  Abstract                 = {Like allozyme variation, heritable variation for polygenic traits is maintained by unknown processes. In an influential paper that combined mathematical analysis with a review of relevant data, Lande (1975) proposed that high levels of variation could be maintained by mutation in the face of stabilizing selection. In addition to presenting an appealing hypothesis for the persistence of heritable variation, Lande's paper spawned a new industry of mathematical analyses for the genetic dynamics of polygenic traits. These analyses are based on a model that assumes only additive allelic effects and a continuum of alleles at each locus. In addition, the analyses assume that at each locus the distribution of allelic effects segregating in a population is approximately Gaussian. The mathematical tractability of the resulting Gaussian genetic model permits analytical treatment of formidable multilocus problems. Despite its widespread use, relatively little attention has been devoted to the biological and mathematical assumptions underlying this model. Using both mathematical and empirical evidence, I demonstrate that the Gaussian genetic model relies on the unsubstantiated assumption that per locus mutation rates typically exceed 10^-4. I present alternative (non-Gaussian) approximations that apply for lower per locus mutation rates and compare the resulting predictions to those obtained from Gaussian analyses. The primary conclusion is that qualitatively different predictions can arise from conventional analyses that derive rather than assume the distribution of allele effects. In particular, I argue that it will be very difficult to test the hypothesis that significant levels of heritable variation are maintained by mutation-selection balance.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous mathematical analyses of mutation-selection balance for metric traits assume that selection acts on the relevant loci only through the character(s) under study. Thus, they implicitly assume that all of the relevant mutation and selection parameters are estimable. A more realistic analysis must recognize that many of the pleiotropic effects of loci contributing variation to a given character are not known. To explore the consequences of these hidden effects, I analyze models of two pleiotropically connected polygenic traits, denoted P1 and P2. The actual equilibrium genetic variance for P1, based on complete knowledge of all mutation and selection parameters for both P1 and P2, can be compared to a prediction based solely on observations of P1. This extrapolation mimics empirically obtainable predictions because of the inevitability of unknown pleiotropic effects. The mutation parameters relevant to P1 are assumed to be known, but selection intensity is estimated from the within-generation reduction of phenotypic variance for P1. The extrapolated prediction is obtained by substituting these parameters into formulas based on single-character analyses. Approximate analytical and numerical results show that the level of agreement between these univariate extrapolations and the actual equilibrium variance depends critically on both the genetic model assumed and the relative magnitudes of the mutation and selection parameters. Unless per locus mutation rates are extremely high, i.e., generally greater than 10-4, the widely used gaussian approximation for genetic effects at individual loci is not applicable. Nevertheless, the gaussian approximations predict that the true and extrapolated equilibria are in reasonable agreement, i.e., within a factor of two, over a wide range of parameter values. In contrast, an alternative approximation that applies for moderate and low per locus mutation rates predicts that the extrapolation will generally overestimate the true equilibrium variance unless there is little selection associated with hidden effects. The tendency to overestimate is understandable because selection acts on all of the pleiotropic manifestations of a new mutation, but equilibrium covariances among the characters affected may not reveal all of this selection. This casts doubt on the proposal that much of the additive polygenic variance observed in natural populations can be explained by mutation-selection balance. It also indicates the difficulty of critically evaluating this hypothesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Most quantitative traits in most populations exhibit heritable genetic variation. Lande proposed that high levels of heritable variation may be maintained by mutation in the face of stabilizing selection. Several analyses have appeared of two distinct models with n additive polygenic loci subject to mutation and stabilizing selection. Each is reviewed and a new analysis and model are presented. Lande and Fleming analyzed extensions of a model originally treated by Kimura which assumes a continuum of possible allelic effects at each locus. Latter and Bulmer analyzed a model with diallelic loci. The published analyses of these models lead to qualitatively different predictions concerning the dependence of the equilibrium genetic variance on the underlying biological parameters. A new asymptotic analysis of the Kimura model shows that the different predictions are not consequences of the number of alleles assumed but rather are attributable to assumptions concerning the relative magnitudes of per locus mutation rates, the phenotypic effects of mutation, and the intensity of selection. This conclusion is reinforced by analysis of a model with triallelic loci. None of the approximate analyses presented are mathematically rigorous. To quantify their accuracy and display the domains of validity for alternative approximations, numerically determined equilibria are presented. In addition, empirical estimates of mutation rates and selection intensity are reviewed, revealing weaknesses in both the data and its connection to the models. Although the mathematical results and underlying biological requirements of my analyses are quite different from those of Lande, the results do not refute his hypothesis that considerable additive genetic variance may be maintained by mutation-selection balance. However, I argue that the validity of this hypothesis can only be determined with additional data and mathematics.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop a general population genetic framework for analyzing selection on many loci, and apply it to strong truncation and disruptive selection on an additive polygenic trait. We first present statistical methods for analyzing the infinitesimal model, in which offspring breeding values are normally distributed around the mean of the parents, with fixed variance. These show that the usual assumption of a Gaussian distribution of breeding values in the population gives remarkably accurate predictions for the mean and the variance, even when disruptive selection generates substantial deviations from normality. We then set out a general genetic analysis of selection and recombination. The population is represented by multilocus cumulants describing the distribution of haploid genotypes, and selection is described by the relation between mean fitness and these cumulants. We provide exact recursions in terms of generating functions for the effects of selection on non-central moments. The effects of recombination are simply calculated as a weighted sum over all the permutations produced by meiosis. Finally, the new cumulants that describe the next generation are computed from the non-central moments. Although this scheme is applied here in detail only to selection on an additive trait, it is quite general. For arbitrary epistasis and linkage, we describe a consistent infinitesimal limit in which the short-term selection response is dominated by infinitesimal allele frequency changes and linkage disequilibria. Numerical multilocus results show that the standard Gaussian approximation gives accurate predictions for the dynamics of the mean and genetic variance in this limit. Even with intense truncation selection, linkage disequilibria of order three and higher never cause much deviation from normality. Thus, the empirical deviations frequently found between predicted and observed responses to artificial selection are not caused by linkage-disequilibrium-induced departures from normality. Disruptive selection can generate substantial four-way disequilibria, and hence kurtosis; but even then, the Gaussian assumption predicts the variance accurately. In contrast to the apparent simplicity of the infinitesimal limit, data suggest that changes in genetic variance after 10 or more generations of selection are likely to be dominated by allele frequency dynamics that depend on genetic details.},

  Abstract                 = {Selection on polygenic characters is generally analyzed by statistical methods that assume a Gaussian (normal) distribution of breeding values. We present an alternative analysis based on multilocus population genetics. We use a general representation of selection, recombination, and drift to analyze an idealized polygenic system in which all genetic effects are additive (i.e., both dominance and epistasis are absent), but no assumptions are made about the distribution of breeding values or the numbers of loci or alleles. Our analysis produces three results. First, our equations reproduce the standard recursions for the mean and additive variance if breeding values are Gaussian; but they also reveal how non-Gaussian distributions of breeding values will alter these dynamics. Second, an approximation valid for weak selection shows that even if genetic variance is attributable to an effectively infinite number of loci with only additive effects, selection will generally drive the distribution of breeding values away from a Gaussian distribution by creating multilocus linkage disequilibria. Long-term dynamics of means can depart substantially from the predictions of the standard selection recursions, but the discrepancy may often be negligible for short-term selection. Third, by including mutation, we show that, for realistic parameter values, linkage disequilibrium has little effect on the amount of additive variance maintained at an equilibrium between stabilizing selection and mutation.

Although recent experiments demonstrate a central role for herbivory in driving rapid evolution of defense and competition-mediating traits, whether and how herbivory shapes heritable variation in these traits remains poorly understood. Here, we evaluate the structure and evolutionary stability of the G matrix for plant metabolites that are involved in defense and allelopathy in the tall goldenrod, Solidago altissima. We show that G has evolutionarily diverged between experimentally replicated populations that evolved in the presence versus the absence of ambient herbivory, providing direct evidence for the evolution of G by natural selection. Specifically, evolution in an herbivore-free habitat altered the orientation of G, revealing a negative genetic covariation between defense- and competition-related metabolites that is typically masked in herbivore-exposed populations. Our results may be explained by predictions of classical quantitative genetic theory, as well as the theory of acquisition-allocation trade-offs. The study provides compelling evidence that herbivory drives the evolution of plant genetic architecture.},

  Abstract                 = {Studies of spatial variation in the environment have primarily focused on how genetic variation can be maintained. Many one-locus genetic models have addressed this issue, but, for several reasons, these models are not directly applicable to quantitative (polygenic) traits. One reason is that for continuously varying characters, the evolution of the mean phenotype expressed in different environments (the norm of reaction) is also of interest. Our quantitative genetic models describe the evolution of phenotypic response to the environment, also known as phenotypic plasticity (Gause, 1947), and illustrate how the norm of reaction (Schmalhausen, 1949) can be shaped by selection. These models utilize the statistical relationship which exists between genotype-environment interaction and genetic correlation to describe evolution of the mean phenotype under soft and hard selection in coarse-grained environments. Just as genetic correlations among characters within a single environment can constrain the response to simultaneous selection, so can a genetic correlation between states of a character which are expressed in two environments. Unless the genetic correlation across environments is  1, polygenic variation is exhausted, or there is a cost to plasticity, panmictic populations under a bivariate fitness function will eventually attain the optimum mean phenotype for a given character in each environment. However, very high positive or negative correlations can substantially slow the rate of evolution and may produce temporary maladaptation in one environment before the optimum joint phenotype is finally attained.

Evolutionary trajectories under hard and soft selection can differ: in hard selection, the environments with the highest initial mean fitness contribute most individuals to the mating pool. In both hard and soft selection, evolution toward the optimum in a rare environment is much slower than it is in a common one.

A subdivided population model reveals that migration restriction can facilitate local adaptation. However, unless there is no migration or one of the special cases discussed for panmictic populations holds, no geographical variation in the norm of reaction will be maintained at equilibrium. Implications of these results for the interpretation of spatial patterns of phenotypic variation in natural populations are discussed.},

They develop a quantitative genetic model that describe the evolution of phenotypic response to the environment, also known as phenotypic plasticity (Gause, 1947), and illustrate how the norm of reaction (Schmalhausen, 1949) can be shaped by selection. They specificially look at how evolutionary trajectories under hard and soft selection can differ: in hard selection, the environments with the highest initial mean fitness contribute most individuals to the mating pool. In both hard and soft selection, evolution toward the optimum in a rare environment is much slower than it is in a common one.}

  Abstract                 = {Asymmetry in correlated responses to selection is expected when more than one cycle of selection is practised due to changes in genetic parameters produced by selection. In large populations, under the infinitesimal model these changes are due to linkage disequilibrium generated by selection and not to gene frequency changes. This study examines the conditions under which asymmetrical correlated responses are to be expected when an infinitesimal model is considered. Asymmetrical correlated responses in two traits in respect to which trait is selected are expected if the two traits have different heritabilities. Predicted asymmetry increases with the absolute value of the genetic correlation between the two traits, the difference between the two heritabilities, the intensity of selection and the number of generations of selection. Linkage disequilibrium generated by selection should be taken into account in explaining asymmetrical correlated responses observed in selection experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {A multivariate quantitative genetic model is analyzed that is based on the assumption that the genetic variation at a locus j primarily influences an underlying physiological variable yj, while influence on the genotypic values is determined by a kind of "developmental function" which is not changed by mutations at this locus. Assuming additivity among loci the developmental function becomes a linear transformation of the underlying variables y onto the genotypic values x, x = By. In this way the pleiotropic effects become constrained by the structure of the B-matrix. The equilibrium variance under mutation-stabilizing selection balance in infinite and finite populations is derived by using the house of cards approximation. The results are compared to the predictions given by M. Turelli in 1985 for pleiotropic two-character models. It is shown that the B-matrix model gives the same results as Turelli's five-allele model, suggesting that the crucial factor determining the equilibrium variance in multivariate models with pleiotropy is the assumption about constraints on the pleiotropic effects, and not the number of alleles as proposed by Turelli. Finally it is shown that under Gaussian stabilizing selection the structure of the B-matrix has effectively no influence on the mean equilibrium fitness of an infinite population. Hence the B-matrix and consequently to some extent also the structure of the genetic correlation matrix is an almost neutral character. The consequences for the evolution of genetic covariance matrices are discussed.},

-**median degree of pleiotropy in morphology: mice (all major subsystems of bony skeleton, selected incr/dcrs body size) 102 QTLs for 70 traits (median degree of pleiotropy = 6 traits); for two species of threespine stickle-back 54 traits median = 1 trait
-**Wang et al (ref28) shows that med deg of pleiotropy = 7 morph traits (study of 2449 genes / 253 morph traits)
-**DEF: type I pleiotropy is single gene coding product with multiple molecular functions, type II pleiotropy single gene coding product with one molecular function involved in multiple processes
-** in yeast, pleiotropy is mostly of type II (gene with single function involved in multiple processes)
-**most genes in genome are not highly pleiotropic, gene-trait relation is strongly modular, and pleiotropy does not hinder the evolution of complex organisms
-**technical definition of pleiotropy has problem: how does one distinguish between a pleiotropic mutation and two closely linked mutations
-*is pleiotropy property of gene or not? ex. mutation of cis-regulation of two nearby genes (if prop of gene then no, if not then yes)
-*what is phenotypic character? ex. are different measures of same skull different characters?
-*need to distinguish between pleiotropy of gene (loss of functions from knockout) versus pleiotropy of mutations (altered functions from new allele)
-single gene affecting multiple functions, versus polygenic (multifactorial) traits
-ex. of pleiotropic gene is human homeobox "ARX" responsible for phenotype ambiguous genitalia to lissencephaly (smooth parts/whole regions of brain)
-ex. of pleiotropic gene is human "AMT" (phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase gene) causes cerebellar ataxia, telangiectases (visibly dilated blood vessels skin/mucosal surface), immune defects & malignancy-predisposition
-important: cost of complexity hypothesis: complex organisms are inherently less evolvable or adaptable to changing environments than simpler organisms
-DEF: universal pleiotropy: every gene affects every trait
-Box1: Fishers Geometric model FGM, uses ex of microscope with more or less knobs. More of them means less chance of random tuning improving fitness.
-mutation pleiotropy tends to be smaller than gene pleiotropy, estimates of latter through gene knockout (conditioned on not being lethal) give upperbound for former
-DEF: A quantitative trait locus (QTL) is a section of DNA (the locus) that correlates with variation in a phenotype (the quantitative trait). Usually the QTL is linked to, or contains, the genes that control that phenotype.

These units can be considered as modular parts of the body which integrate functionally related characters into units of evolutionary transformation. These units may either emerge spontaneously by self-organization, or may be the product of natural selection. A selection scenario that could explain the origin of modular units needs to explain the differential suppression of pleiotropic effects between different modules and the augmentation of pleiotropic effects among the elements within the module. Four scenarios are discussed: selection for adaptation rate, constructional selection, stabilizing selection and a combination of directional and stabilizing selection. It is concluded that a combination of directional and stabilizing selection is a prevalent mode of selection and a likely explanation for the evolution of modularity.},

  Abstract                 = {Evolutionary theory predicts that genetic constraints should be widespread, but empirical support for their existence is surprisingly rare. Commonly applied univariate and bivariate approaches to detecting genetic constraints can underestimate their prevalence, with important aspects potentially tractable only within a multivariate framework. However, multivariate genetic analyses of data from natural populations are challenging because of modest sample sizes, incomplete pedigrees, and missing data. Here we present results from a study of a comprehensive set of life history traits (juvenile survival, age at first breeding, annual fecundity, and longevity) for both males and females in a wild, pedigreed, population of red deer (Cervus elaphus). We use factor analytic modeling of the genetic variance-covariance matrix (G) to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and take a multivariate approach to estimating genetic constraints. We consider a range of metrics designed to assess the effect of G on the deflection of a predicted response to selection away from the direction of fastest adaptation and on the evolvability of the traits. We found limited support for genetic constraint through genetic covariances between traits, both within sex and between sexes. We discuss these results with respect to other recent findings and to the problems of estimating these parameters for natural populations.},

These two observations are in direct conflict as such selection should deplete genetic variation. Furthermore, the presence of genetic variation in a trait, and selection acting on that trait, is often not sufficient for the trait to respond to selection. Here, we bring together geometric perspectives on mutation, selection, and genetic variation and show how the perceived incompatibility between these two observations is a consequence of taking a trait-by-trait approach to the multivariate problem of genetic variation and selection.

-fundamental contradicition at the heart of evolutionary biology: "genetic variation is maintained in natural populations in the presence of strong selection."
-goal of review: "establish the link between fundmental this fundamental contradiction and genetic limitations

READING NOTES
-two important observations that lead to scientific contradiction in evolutionary biology
1) widespread variance - substantial genetic variation maintained in natural populations in presence of strong selection
2) strong selection - life history traits which are under stronger selection,display more genetic variation than other types of traits (but even large Ve, hence lower heritability)

-trait by trait explanations for the coexistince of observation (1) and (2), in they show that these observations indicate that substantial multivariate genetic constraints in response to selection present in nature
-a geometrical view of genetic constraints inherent in Fisher's model, but a geometric view of genetic contraints emerges slowly until Dickerson 1955 points out deceptiveness of heritabilities and genetic constraints
-
Dickersons example shows that with special G (see paper) and selection in (1,1,1,1) direction combination of traits, there is no genetic variance despite there being genetic variance in each of the traits
-interesting observation: there are G matrices with only positive correlations that will have zero evals, and hence directions that cannot respond to selection
-study of two trait artificial selection experiment with selection response orthogonal to direction of strong genetic correlations, i.e genetic correlations are not effective contraints

-geometric interpretation of G gives reason why simple quantitative genetic measures of genetic variation and covariation have been unsuccessful in demonstrating genetic constraints
-eigenvalues of G are more informative than heritabilities or genetic correlations
-considerable interest in determining the statistical support of the genetic variance in an estimated G, and how many dimensions required to describe this subspace of significant genetic variation
-rank of P (phenotypic covariance matrix) sets an upper bound on the rang of G
-G-matrices are often ill conditioned (Kirkpatrick 2009), supports Barton's first conjecture, likely fewer genetically independent traits than phenotypes measured
-genetic correlation between male and female fitness may be negative due to evolution of sexual dimorphism (lande 1980, kirkpatrick 2009), so some fitness in both might be maintained by antagonistic pleiotropy
-widely applicable metric for measuring multivariate constraint comparable across studies is angle between $\beta$ and predicted response to selection $\Delta \bar{z}$, 0=no constraint, 90=abs. constraint
-robertson's secondary theorem of natural selection: the response in a trait equals its additive genetic covariance with fitness, $\Delta z = \sigma_A (z, w)$
-
in Lande and Arnolds regression approximation of fitness w = a + bz + zyz, the y terms give the local curvature of the fitness landscape, and y_ij !=0 suggests correlation selection
-Barton's conjectures (1990):
1) there is likely to be substanstially fewer genetically independent traits than measured phenotypes
2) only a few traits can be under strong stabilizing selection

Conclusions
1) depletion of genetic variation by strong selection maybe hidden in geometric complexities of multiple traits
2) trait combinations should display little genetic variation if strong selection present, but weak selection on other combinations can maintain larger variances
**) It be interesting if there is any differential geometry applications in the theory of fitness landscapes

COMMENTS FOR PAPER
-Fisher 1930 gives a model for adaptation with multiple traits to explain how in higher dimensional trait spaces
-Extensions to Fisher's model given by Kimura 1983 and Orr 1998, 2000
-Lande develops the multivariate breeder's equation (Lande's eqtn) in 1979 paper $\delta z = G \beta$
-**implications for how genetic constraints are manifested within G remain largely under appreciated, with more focus on estimation and interpretation
-Numerous experiments demonstrating genetic variance in almost any trait, can safely assume presence of genetic variance in any metric character
-**most genetic correlations are positive, but correlations among life history traits tend to be negative, more so than among physiological or morphological traits (Roff 1996)

COMMENTS FOR PRESENTATION

-slide #2 - Numerous experiments demonstrating genetic variance in almost any trait, can safely assume presence of genetic variance in any metric character (lynch & walsh 1998, brakefield 2003)

  Abstract                 = {The genetic covariance and correlation matrices for five morphological traits were estimated from four populations of fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, to measure the extent of change in genetic covariances as a result of directional selection. Two of the populations were derived from lines that had undergone selection for large or small thorax length over the preceding 23 generations. A third population was constituted using flies from control lines that were maintained with equivalent population sizes as the selected lines. The fourth population contained flies from the original cage population from which the selected and control lines had been started. Tests of the homogeneity of covariance matrices using maximum likelihood techniques revealed significant changes in covariance structure among the selected lines. Prediction of base population trait means from selected line means under the assumption of constant genetic covariances indicated that genetic covariances for the small population differed more from the base population than did the covariances for the large population. The predicted small population means diverged farther from the expected means because the additive genetic variance associated with several traits increased in value and most of the genetic covariances associated with one trait changed in sign. These results illustrate that genetic covariances may remain nearly constant in some situations while changing markedly in others. Possible developmental reasons for the genetic changes are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Genetic correlations between traits determine the multivariate response to selection in the short term, and thereby play a causal role in evolutionary change. Although individual studies have documented environmentally induced changes in genetic correlations, the nature and extent of environmental effects on multivariate genetic architecture across species and environments remain largely uncharacterized. We reviewed the literature for estimates of the genetic variance-covariance (G) matrix in multiple environments, and compared differences in G between environments to the divergence in G between conspecific populations (measured in a common garden). We found that the predicted evolutionary trajectory differed as strongly between environments as it did between populations. Between-environment differences in the underlying structure of G (total genetic variance and the relative magnitude and orientation of genetic correlations) were equal to or greater than between-population differences. Neither environmental novelty, nor the difference in mean phenotype predicted these differences in G. Our results suggest that environmental effects on multivariate genetic architecture may be comparable to the divergence that accumulates over dozens or hundreds of generations between populations. We outline avenues of future research to address the limitations of existing data and characterize the extent to which lability in genetic correlations shapes evolution in changing environments.},

  Abstract                 = {According to New Synthesis doctrine, the direction of evolution is determined by selection and not by ``internal causes'' that act by way of propensities of variation. This doctrine rests on the theoretical claim that because mutation rates are small in comparison to selection coefficients, mutation is powerless to overcome opposing selection. Using a simple population-genetic model, this claim is shown to depend on assuming the prior availability of variation, so that mutation may act only as a ``pressure'' on the frequencies of existing alleles, and not as the evolutionary process that introduces novelty. As shown here, mutational bias in the introduction of novelty can strongly influence the course of evolution, even when mutation rates are small in comparison to selection coefficients. Recognizing this mode of causation provides a distinct mechanistic basis for an ``internalis'' approach to determining the contribution of mutational and developmental factors to evolutionary phenomena such as homoplasy, parallelism, and directionality.},

The model assumes that the stabilizing component is less variable than the directional component among populations. The major result is that, within a population, the responses of characters to selection in the short term differ qualitatively from those in the long term. In the short term, the responses depend on genetic correlations between characters, but in the long term they are only determined by the fitness functions of stabilizing and directional selection, independent of genetic and phenotypic correlations. Treating the stabilizing component as a constant and assuming the directional component to vary among populations, I present formulas for the interpopulation covariation and interspecific allometry, which are functions of the intensity matrix of stabilizing selection. Particular attention is paid to the relationship between intra- and interpopulation correlations.},

-
trade-offs are key assumption of optimality models for life history evolution
-researchers have been interested in the physiological causes of trade-offs for more than six decades (roff, zera, stearns)
-most have thought trade-offs are the result of competition among internal organismal functions for limited internal resources (allocation principle)
-environmental factors can also cause trade-offs, e.g. predation vs reproduction 
-NEGATIVE TRAIT ASSOCIATIONS DUE TO LINKAGE ARE NOT TRADE-OFFS!
-INAPPROPRIATE TO APPLY TERM EVOLUTIONARY ADAPTATION TO A TRAIT WITH EVIDENCE OF NATURAL SELECTION SHAPING ITS FORM OR FUNCTION
-classical studies of trade-offs in birds concern clutch size
-plastic responses of a trade-off are determined by priority rules (see fig 1 in Stearns 1989), priority rules are shaped by ecological factors
-capital versus income breeding: "income breeding" - resources for reproduction acquired during reproduction period, "capital breeding" - reproduction resources derived from stores acquired during earlier period
-3 main empirical approaches used to investigate life history trade-offs: 1) measurement of phenotypics correlation in unmanipulated individuals, 2) genetic analysis, 3) experimental manipulations of phenotypes
-one school of thought is that genetically based covariation should be the focus of attention in trade-off studies since only genetically based traits can evolve
-Question: what is an example of a non genetic trade-off?
-Note: genetic approaches difficult to carryout, limited in scope, in comparison to phenotypic studies
-wing polymorphism (flight capable morph vs non flight capable morph) is an exceptional experimental model for investigating physiological trade-off - early fecundity negatively associated with flight capability
-ex. Gryllus firmus increased ovarian growth in flightless morph 200-400\%, reduction in flight muscles 40\%, reduction in triglyceride reserves by 30\%
-flight muscle growth does not appear to trade-off with ovarian growth (indicated by timing; 1st 2-3 days for latter) 

-D. melanogaster has been used to investigate trade-offs with genetic approaches
-short larval period correlated with reduced larval viability, diminished adult size and reduced fecundity (Nunney 1996, Chippindale et al. 1997).

Using more general models, however, it has recently been shown that it is indeed a sufficient mechanism. These models can be used to explore other phenomena in evolutionary biology.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate maintenance of quantitative genetic variation at mutation-selection balance for multiple traits. The intrinsic strength of real stabilizing selection on one of these traits denoted the "target trait" and the observed strength of apparent stabilizing selection on the target trait can be quite different: the latter, which is estimable, is much smaller (i.e., implying stronger selection) than the former. Distinguishing them may enable the mutation load to be relaxed when considering multivariate stabilizing selection. It is shown that both correlations among mutational effects and among strengths of real stabilizing selection on the traits are not important unless they are high. The analysis for independent situations thus provides a good approximation to the case where mutant and stabilizing selection effects are correlated. Multivariate stabilizing selection can be regarded as a combination of stabilizing selection on the target trait and the pleiotropic direct selection on fitness that is solely due to the effects of real stabilizing selection on the hidden traits. As the overall fitness approaches a constant value as the number of traits increases, multivariate stabilizing selection can maintain abundant genetic variance only under quite weak selection. The common observations of high polygenic variance and strong stabilizing selection thus imply that if the mutation-selection balance is the true mechanism of maintenance of genetic variation, the apparent stabilizing selection cannot arise solely by real stabilizing selection simultaneously on many metric traits.},

  Abstract                 = {In quantitative genetics, there are two basic "conflicting" observations: abundant polygenic variation and strong stabilizing selection that should rapidly deplete that variation. This conflict, although having attracted much theoretical attention, still stands open. Two classes of model have been proposed: real stabilizing selection directly on the metric trait under study and apparent stabilizing selection caused solely by the deleterious pleiotropic side effects of mutations on fitness. Here these models are combined and the total stabilizing selection observed is assumed to derive simultaneously through these two different mechanisms. Mutations have effects on a metric trait and on fitness, and both effects vary continuously. The genetic variance (V(G)) and the observed strength of total stabilizing selection (V(s,t)) are analyzed with a rare-alleles model. Both kinds of selection reduce V(G) but their roles in depleting it are not independent: The magnitude of pleiotropic selection depends on real stabilizing selection and such dependence is subject to the shape of the distributions of mutational effects. The genetic variation maintained thus depends on the kurtosis as well as the variance of mutational effects: All else being equal, V(G) increases with increasing leptokurtosis of mutational effects on fitness, while for a given distribution of mutational effects on fitness, V(G) decreases with increasing leptokurtosis of mutational effects on the trait. The V(G) and V(s,t) are determined primarily by real stabilizing selection while pleiotropic effects, which can be large, have only a limited impact. This finding provides some promise that a high heritability can be explained under strong total stabilizing selection for what are regarded as typical values of mutation and selection parameters.},
