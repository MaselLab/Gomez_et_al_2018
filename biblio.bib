  abstract = {A method is developed that describes the effects on an arbitrary number of autosomal loci of selection on haploid and diploid stages, of nonrandom mating between haploid individuals, and of recombination. We provide exact recursions for the dynamics of allele frequencies and linkage disequilibria (nonrandom associations of alleles across loci). When selection is weak relative to recombination, our recursions provide simple approximations for the linkage disequilibria among arbitrary combinations of loci. We show how previous models of sex-independent natural selection on diploids, assortative mating between haploids, and sexual selection on haploids can be analyzed in this framework. Using our weak-selection approximations, we derive new results concerning the coevolution of male traits and female preferences under natural and sexual selection. In particular, we provide general expressions for the intensity of linkage-disequilibrium induced selection experienced by loci that contribute to female preferences for specific male traits. Our general results support the previous observation that these indirect selection forces are so weak that they are unlikely to dominate the evolution of preference-producing loci.},

  abstract = {A general representation of multilocus selection is extended to allow recombination to depend on genotype. The equations simplify if modifier alleles have small effects on recombination. The evolution of such modifiers only depends on how they alter recombination between the selected loci, and does not involve dominance in modifier effects. The net selection on modifiers can be found explicitly if epistasis is weak relative to recombination. This analysis shows that recombination can be favoured in two ways: because it impedes the response to epistasis which fluctuates in sign, or because it facilitates the response to directional selection. The first mechanism is implausible, because epistasis must change sign over periods of a few generations: faster or slower fluctuations favour reduced recombination. The second mechanism requires weak negative epistasis between favourable alleles, which may either be increasing, or held in check by mutation. The selection (s^ on recombination modifiers depends on the reduction in additive variance of log (fitness) due to linkage disequilibria (vx < 0), and on non-additive variance in log (fitness) (V1', V2',  epistasis between 2, 3.. loci). For unlinked loci and pairwise epistasis, j , = — (v1 + 4V2/3)Sr, where 8r is the average increase in recombination caused by the modifier. The approximations are checked against exact calculations for three loci, and against Charlesworth's analyses of mutation/selection balance (1990), and directional selection (1993). The analysis demonstrates a general relation between selection on recombination and observable components of fitness variation, which is open to experimental test.},

A general qualitative feature of such systems is that the genetic variance for the character is independent of the linkage map of the loci, provided linkage is not very tight. A particular detailed model shows that certain aspects of the genetic system are moulded by stabilizing selection while others are selectively neutral. With reference to experimental data on characters of Drosophila flies, maize, and mice, it is concluded that large amounts of genetic variation can be maintained by mutation in polygenic characters even when there is strong stabilizing selection. The properties of the model are compared with those of heterotic models with linked loci.},

  abstract  = {Dynamic models of quantitative (polygenic) characters are more generally applicable in the analysis of life history evolution than are static optimization methods or one and two locus genetic models. A dynamic theory of life history evolution is derived by synthesizing population demography with quantitative genetics. In a population under weak selection with a nearly stable age distribution, the relative fitness of individuals with a particular life history phenotype can be approximated as an average of age—specific relative fecundity and mortality rates, weighted respectively by the present productivity and future reproductive value of each age—class. An adaptive topography is constructed showing that, with phenotype— and age—specific fecundity and mortality rates constant in time, evolution of the mean life history maximizes the intrinsic rate of increase of a population. However, the rate and direction of evolution in response to selection are strongly influenced by genetic correlations among characters. Negative genetic correlations among major components of fitness are often obscured phenotypically by positive environmental correlations, but commonly constitute the ultimate constraint on life history evolution, as illustrated by artificial selection experiments. Methods are suggested for measuring selective forces and evolutionary constraints that effect life history characters in natural populations.},

heredity. As he not,�d, this demands statistical analysis of phenotypic variation (including both variances and correlations), of fitness as a function of phenotype, and of the similarities between parents and offspring. His call, in 1893 , for additional empirical studies of selection in the wild was repeated by Endler in 1986. In his first statistical analyses of multiple characters, Weldon (247, 248) asked whether phenotypic correlations an<t variances from one population were applicable to others. Like Lofsvold (156) and Kohn & Atchley ( 129), he l'ound that correlations were relatively constant, but variances were not.

  abstract  = {A basic principle of natural selection on correlated characters is expressed as an adaptive topography for the vector of mean phenotypes in a population. Under some simple conditions on the pattern of phenotypic and genetic covariation within populations, selection only on body size, certain types of multivariate selection, and random genetic drift in a stochastic phylogeny are each expected to produce allometric evolution, i.e., straight lines or linear regressions on logarithmic coordinates. The orientation of these lines is determined by genetic parameters of the populations. Using this theory, phylogenetic or comparative information can be combined with experimental data on population genetic parameters to test hypotheses about past selective forces. Data from selection experiments on brain and body weights in mice support the conclusions that [1] the short-term differentiation of brain and body sizes in very closely related mammalian forms resulted either from directional selection mostly on body size with changes in brain sizes largely a genetically correlated response, or from random genetic drift; [2] during the long-term allometric diversification within most mammalian orders there has been more net directional selection on brain sizes than on body sizes. It is suggested that encephalization in primates decreased the genetic correlation between brain size and body size within populations, which facilitated further encephalization in the human lineage by avoiding antagonistic selection on brain and body sizes. The evolution of brain:body ontogeny is briefly discussed.},

Selective effects are readily detectable in characters that do not change with age, such as meristic traits or adult characters in species with determinate growth. Ontogenetic characters, including allometric growth rates, can be analyzed in longitudinal studies where individuals are followed through time. Following an approach pioneered by Pearson (1903), this analysis helps to reveal the target(s) of selection, and to quantify its intensity, without identifying the selective agent(s). By accounting for indirect selection through correlated characters, separate forces of directional and stabilizing (or disruptive) selection acting directly on each character can be measured. These directional and stabilizing selection coefficients are respectively the parameters that describe the best linear and quadratic approximations to the selective surface of individual fitness as a function of the phenotypic characters. The theory is illustrated by estimating selective forces on morphological characters influencing survival in pentatomid bugs and in house sparrows during severe weather conditions.},

But when they are common, many beneficial mutations will occur before any can fix, so there will be many different mutant lineages in the population concurrently. In an asexual population, these different mutant lineages interfere and not all can fix simultaneously. In addition, further beneficial mutations can accumulate in mutant lineages while these are still a minority of the population. In this article, we analyze the dynamics of such multiple mutations and the interplay between multiple mutations and interference between clones. These result in substantial variation in fitness accumulating within a single asexual population. The amount of variation is determined by a balance between selection, which destroys variation, and beneficial mutations, which create more. The behavior depends in a subtle way on the population parameters: the population size, the beneficial mutation rate, and the distribution of the fitness increments of the potential beneficial mutations. The mutation–selection balance leads to a continually evolving population with a steady-state fitness variation. This variation increases logarithmically with both population size and mutation rate and sets the rate at which the population accumulates beneficial mutations, which thus also grows only logarithmically with population size and mutation rate. These results imply that mutator phenotypes are less effective in larger asexual populations. They also have consequences for the advantages (or disadvantages) of sex via the Fisher–Muller effect; these are discussed briefly.},

-For the mutator populations, some corrections were required, but after making them, the estimates better fits.

EXPERIMENT:
-examined yeast in glucose limited media evolving for 500 generations at three different effective population sizes (1.4e3, 7e4, 3.5e6)
-two population types: (1) "nonmutator" types and (2) "mutator" types (msh\Delta) with x10 Ub
-1 gen 130 min in selected media
-assay consisted of measuring fitness by sampling population and mixing with ancestral strain (identified with yellow fluorescent protein), growth for 20 generations and determining ratios of two
-total fitness change over 500 gens used to measure average speed of evolution
-fitness distribution also measured for some of the populations by isolating 96 individuals and measuring their individual fitness
-experiment showed no indication that mean fitness of population was slowing down

COMMENTS:
-the authors comment that their "nonmutator" populations increased in fitness by something like 4-7% in 500 generations, est of v_nonm, and 
-This is not enought time for two mutations adding up to that amount to fix in succession (basically, multiple mutations must be at work)
-
Ub and s are fitted to the data, shown to be Ub = 2.4e-4 and s=2% for mutators, Ub=2.4e-5 for non mutators, and explaining of how these fits are obtained are briefly mentioned in figure 4

We used a 25-year-long individual-based field study on almost 7000 breeding attempts of the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis) to estimate the stability of the G-matrix over time. Using animal models to estimate G for several time periods, we show that the structure of the time-specific G-matrices changed significantly over time. The temporal changes in the G-matrix were unpredictable, and the structure at one time period was not indicative of the structure at the next time period. Moreover, we show that the changes in the time-specific G-matrices were not related to changes in mean trait values or due to genetic drift. Selection, differences in acquisition/allocation patterns or environment-dependent allelic effects are therefore likely explanations for the patterns observed, probably in combination. Our result cautions against assuming constancy of the G-matrix and indicates that even short-term evolutionary predictions in natural populations can be very challenging.},

COMMENTS:
-It seems for this data, G-matrices are unable to explain how traits response to artificial selection.  It would be interesting to see if perhaps our model could explain the behavior of the data from this field study.  Also, it might be interesting to see if our model obeys the laws of quantitative genetics expressed in the breeder’s equation.  Can this be outputted as a means to obtain confidence in this framework?
-Six G-matrices were estimated, with differences in pedigree accounted for by ensuring that no relationship between pedigree structure (measure as either mean relatedness, number of individuals, or number of sibs) and estimated evolvability, respondability or conditional evolvability.
-Four traits were measured: tails, tars, wing and mass.
-Their results show that genetic covariances will affect the outcome of selection in all time periods, but in different ways within each.
-Figure three in the paper shows that genetic covariances act more to constrain response to selection.
-Authors suspect effects of indirect selection that complicates the analysis (Bjorklund & Gustafsson >2013).
-Lack of any patterns in expression of genes likely because of time, population and environment (Falconer & MacKay 1989). 
-In all period there is a dimension of G that doesn’t respond to selection, but it changes in each time period.
-One major proposition of authors in light of their results is that if G changes quickly in response to selection (or changes in the variation of acquisition of resources), the our ability to predict long term evolutionary change is limited and valid for periods of time where G is stable.
-G-matrices from different time periods were compared using the eigen tensor approach.

Molecular, cellular, developmental, physiological, neurological, and behavioral systems are each fascinating in and of themselves, but it is their interaction that generates what we see as the organism as a whole. By necessity, biologists have a tendency to break down organisms into their component parts to see how they work. Yet, no trait is an island (Dobzhansky 1956). In particular, we need to consider the organism in its entirety when looking at evolutionary change. This perspective is necessitated simply by the fact that it is the whole individual, not specific traits or particular alleles, that lives and dies. The whole individual is therefore the central unit of selection (Lewontin 1970). How can we deal with the complexity inherent in trying to integrate biological function and evolutionary change across the whole organism? Quantitative genetics provides an attractive potential framework because it attempts to summarize important features of the genetic system while focusing firmly at the level of the phenotype. The multiple trait (multivariate) formulations of quantitative genetics that we will discuss here can be seen both as a conceptual framework for integrating multiple systems at many levels and as a tool for making quantitative predictions about evolutionary change. Whether it succeeds on either count is the subject of active debate (Barton and Turelli 1989). Ways of successfully building upon the traditional statistical framework of quantitative genetics is one of the exciting areas of future growth within the field of evolutionary genetics.},

COMMENTS:
-G evolution depends on selection and other forces, see equation in box 3
-Phillips states that “we know very little about how G evolves,” (bottom of first page), made explicit by equation in box 3 which has other components that cannot easily be estimated
-the implications are that we do not know whether micro- or macroevolution is what molds and changes a G-matrix of a population.
-Divergence in populations is discussed as being understood within this multivariate framework of quantitative genetics.  This would definitely be worth following up on.

  abstract  = {The G-matrix summarizes the inheritance of multiple, phenotypic traits. The stability and evolution of this matrix are important issues because they affect our ability to predict how the phenotypic traits evolve by selection and drift. Despite the centrality of these issues, comparative, experimental, and analytical approaches to understanding the stability and evolution of the G-matrix have met with limited success. Nevertheless, empirical studies often find that certain structural features of the matrix are remarkably constant, suggesting that persistent selection regimes or other factors promote stability. On the theoretical side, no one has been able to derive equations that would relate stability of the G-matrix to selection regimes, population size, migration, or to the details of genetic architecture. Recent simulation studies of evolving G-matrices offer solutions to some of these problems, as well as a deeper, synthetic understanding of both the G-matrix and adaptive radiations.},

COMMENTS:
-Five emerging generalizations (albeit controversial) in the empirical front: (i) genetic variation is abundant in most populations for many kinds of characters, (ii) variety of lines of evidence suggest phenotypic diversification is primarily driven by selection rather than drift, (iii) Significant evolutionary change can occur over few generations, on an ecological time scale, (iv) Stasis is a prevalent (perhaps the most prevalent) mode of evolution despite evident capacity for rapid evolutionary responses to environmental challenges (implied by i-iii), (v) Correlated evolution of multiple traits is common as reflected by consistent patterns of trait association that are apparent at all levels of divergence.
-Authors argue that an understanding of the adaptive landscape (AL) and its effects on the G-matrix is central to a synthetic vision of emerging generalities in the fields of phenotypic evolution.  
-The individual selection surface (ISS) is like the AL, but with the vertical dimension representing expected relative fitness within a population as a function of trait values.  The AL can be thought of as the ISS average over the phenotypic trait distribution (AL smoother and less curvature).  This construction doesn’t specify any dependence on allele frequencies, which can does affect what selection does.
-BIG QUESTION: What types of quantitative characters (polygenic traits) have relatively stable G-matrices?  My question is whether polygenic traits are the only kind that can be quantitative in nature.  Why not regulatory mechanisms? It would be awesome to create a toy model show how relatively few genes can interact to create a continuum of expression.
-No model for evolution of G-matrix from generation to generation except with very special assumptions (Turelli 1985).
-A key underlying assumption is that trait expression follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution.
-The evolution of populations with multiple traits follows the genetic line of least resistance (Schluter 1996)

  abstract  = {One of the oldest problems in evolutionary biology remains largely unsolved. Which mutations generate evolutionarily relevant phenotypic variation? What kinds of molecular changes do they entail? What are the phenotypic magnitudes, frequencies of origin, and pleiotropic effects of such mutations? How is the genome constructed to allow the observed abundance of phenotypic diversity? Historically, the neo-Darwinian synthesizers stressed the predominance of micromutations in evolution, whereas others noted the similarities between some dramatic mutations and evolutionary transitions to argue for macromutationism. Arguments on both sides have been biased by misconceptions of the developmental effects of mutations. For example, the traditional view that mutations of important developmental genes always have large pleiotropic effects can now be seen to be a conclusion drawn from observations of a small class of mutations with dramatic effects. It is possible that some mutations, for example, those in cis-regulatory DNA, have few or no pleiotropic effects and may be the predominant source of morphological evolution. In contrast, mutations causing dramatic phenotypic effects, although superficially similar to hypothesized evolutionary transitions, are unlikely to fairly represent the true path of evolution. Recent developmental studies of gene function provide a new way of conceptualizing and studying variation that contrasts with the traditional genetic view that was incorporated into neo-Darwinian theory and population genetics. This new approach in developmental biology is as important for microevolutionary studies as the actual results from recent evolutionary developmental studies. In particular, this approach will assist in the task of identifying the specific mutations generating phenotypic variation and elucidating how they alter gene function. These data will provide the current missing link between molecular and phenotypic variation in natural populations.},

I develop a simple architectural model for G for two traits under directional selection constrained by their dependence on a common limiting resource. I assume that genetic variance is maintained by mutation-selection balance. The relative numbers of loci that play a role in acquiring versus allocating a limiting resource play a crucial role in determining genetic covariance. If many loci are involved in acquiring a resource, genetic covariance may be either negative or positive at equilibrium, depending on the fitness function and the input of mutational variance. The form of G does not necessarily reveal the constraint on resource acquisition inherent in the system, and therefore studies estimating G do not test for the existence of life-history tradeoffs. Characters may evolve in patterns that are unpredictable from G. Experiments are suggested that would indicate if this model could explain observations of positive genetic covariance.},

In the simplest case, unlinked loci and uncorrelated phenotypes respond directly to multivariate selection and permit unrestricted paths to adaptive peaks. By contrast, {\textquoteleft}antagonistic{\textquoteright} pleiotropic loci may constrain adaptation by affecting variation of many traits and limiting the direction of trait correlations to vectors that are not favoured by selection. However, certain pleiotropic configurations may improve the conditions for adaptive evolution.

Derived, low expression FRI alleles confer a {\textquoteleft}drought escape{\textquoteright} strategy owing to fast growth, low water use efficiency and early flowering. By contrast, a dehydration avoidance strategy is conferred by the ancestral phenotype of late flowering, slow growth and efficient water use during photosynthesis. The dehydration avoidant phenotype was recovered when genotypes with null FRI alleles were transformed with functional alleles. Our findings indicate that the well-documented effects of FRI on phenology result from differences in physiology, not only a simple developmental switch.},

results
-*** identified QTLs underlying expression differences of 570 genes two strains (lab vs vineyard) of yeast (32% self-linked). yeast genome divided into 661 20kb segments (excluding segs affect zero traits) median deg plei= 1 trait (8 segs affect 7-94 traits in trans)
-**median degree of pleiotropy in morphology: mice (all major subsystems of bony skeleton, selected incr/dcrs body size) 102 QTLs for 70 traits (median degree of pleiotropy = 6 traits); for two species of threespine stickle-back 54 traits median = 1 trait
-**Wang et al (ref28) shows that med deg of pleiotropy = 7 morph traits (study of 2449 genes / 253 morph traits)
-**DEF: type I pleiotropy is single gene coding product with multiple molecular functions, type II pleiotropy single gene coding product with one molecular function involved in multiple processes
-** in yeast, pleiotropy is mostly of type II (gene with single function involved in multiple processes)
-**most genes in genome are not highly pleiotropic, gene-trait relation is strongly modular, and pleiotropy does not hinder the evolution of complex organisms
-**technical definition of pleiotropy has problem: how does one distinguish between a pleiotropic mutation and two closely linked mutations
-*is pleiotropy property of gene or not? ex. mutation of cis-regulation of two nearby genes (if prop of gene then no, if not then yes)
-*what is phenotypic character? ex. are different measures of same skull different characters?
-*need to distinguish between pleiotropy of gene (loss of functions from knockout) versus pleiotropy of mutations (altered functions from new allele)
-single gene affecting multiple functions, versus polygenic (multifactorial) traits
-ex. of pleiotropic gene is human homeobox "ARX" responsible for phenotype ambiguous genitalia to lissencephaly (smooth parts/whole regions of brain)
-ex. of pleiotropic gene is human "AMT" (phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase gene) causes cerebellar ataxia, telangiectases (visibly dilated blood vessels skin/mucosal surface), immune defects & malignancy-predisposition
-important: cost of complexity hypothesis: complex organisms are inherently less evolvable or adaptable to changing environments than simpler organisms
-DEF: universal pleiotropy: every gene affects every trait
-Box1: Fishers Geometric model FGM, uses ex of microscope with more or less knobs.  More of them means less chance of random tuning improving fitness.
-mutation pleiotropy tends to be smaller than gene pleiotropy, estimates of latter through gene knockout (conditioned on not being lethal) give upperbound for former
-DEF: A quantitative trait locus (QTL) is a section of DNA (the locus) that correlates with variation in a phenotype (the quantitative trait). Usually the QTL is linked to, or contains, the genes that control that phenotype.
-invariant total effect model: total effect size of mutation is constant (higher degree => lower eff size per trait)
-Euclidean superposition model: effect size of mutation is constant per trait (higer degree=>larger total effec size)

Negative disequilibrium reduces the variance in fitness and hence, by Fisher{\textquoteright}s (1930) fundamental theorem, slows the rate of increase in mean fitness. Modifiers that increase recombination eliminate the negative disequilibria that impede selection and consequently increase in frequency by {\textquotedblleft}hitchhiking.{\textquotedblright} Thus, stochastic fluctuations in linkage disequilibrium in finite populations favor the evolution of increased rates of recombination, even in the absence of epistatic interactions among loci and even when disequilibrium is initially absent. The method developed within this article allows us to quantify the strength of selection acting on a modifier allele that increases recombination in a finite population. The analysis indicates that stochastically generated linkage disequilibria do select for increased recombination, a result that is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations. Selection for a modifier that increases recombination is highest when linkage among loci is tight, when beneficial alleles rise from low to high frequency, and when the population size is small.},

Using data from the literature, we estimate the effect of genetic covariances in real populations. We find no net tendency for covariances to constrain the rate of adaptation, though the quality and heterogeneity of the data limit the certainty of this result. There are some examples in which covariances strongly constrain the rate of adaptation but these are balanced by counter examples in which covariances facilitate the rate of adaptation; in many cases, covariances have little or no effect. We also discuss how our metric can be used to identify traits or suites of traits whose genetic covariances to other traits have a particularly large impact on the rate of adaptation.},

  abstract      = {It is widely held that each gene typically affects many characters, and that each character is affected by many genes. Moreover, strong stabilizing selection cannot act on an indefinitely large number of independent traits. This makes it likely that heritable variation in any one trait is maintained as a side effect of polymorphisms which have nothing to do with selection on that trait. This paper examines the idea that variation is maintained as the pleiotropic side effect of either deleterious mutation, or balancing selection. If mutation is responsible, it must produce alleles which are only mildly deleterious (s approximately 10(-3)), but nevertheless have significant effects on the trait. Balancing selection can readily maintain high heritabilities; however, selection must be spread over many weakly selected polymorphisms if large responses to artificial selection are to be possible. In both classes of pleiotropic model, extreme phenotypes are less fit, giving the appearance of stabilizing selection on the trait. However, it is shown that this effect is weak (of the same order as the selection on each gene): the strong stabilizing selection which is often observed is likely to be caused by correlations with a limited number of directly selected traits. Possible experiments for distinguishing the alternatives are discussed.},

Knowledge of these features of a gene is critical to understand the molecular basis of adaptive evolution. Here we investigate the importance of pleiotropy and epistasis in determining the adaptive value of a candidate gene using the gene FRI (FRIGIDA), which is thought to be the major gene controlling flowering time variation in Arabidopsis thaliana. The effect of FRI on flowering time was analyzed in an outbred population created by randomly mating 19 natural accessions of A. thaliana. This unique population allows the estimation of FRI effects independent of any linkage association with other loci due to demographic processes or to coadapted genes. It also allows for the estimation of pleiotropic effects of FRI on fitness and inflorescence architecture. We found that FRI explains less variation in flowering time than previously observed among natural accessions, and interacts epistatically with the FLC locus. Although early flowering plants produce more fruits under spring conditions, and nonfunctional alleles of FRI were associated with early flowering, variation at FRI was not associated with fitness. We show that nonfunctional FRI alleles have negative pleiotropic effects on fitness by reducing the numbers of nodes and branches on the inflorescence. We propose that these antagonistic pleiotropic effects reduce the adaptive value of FRI, and helps explain the maintenance of alternative life history strategies across natural populations of A. thaliana.},

  abstract  = {Evolution of large asexual cell populations underlies [sim]30% of deaths worldwide, including those caused by bacteria, fungi, parasites, and cancer. However, the dynamics underlying these evolutionary processes remain poorly understood because they involve many competing beneficial lineages, most of which never rise above extremely low frequencies in the population. To observe these normally hidden evolutionary dynamics, we constructed a sequencing-based ultra high-resolution lineage tracking system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that allowed us to monitor the relative frequencies of [sim]500,000 lineages simultaneously. In contrast to some expectations, we found that the spectrum of fitness effects of beneficial mutations is neither exponential nor monotonic. Early adaptation is a predictable consequence of this spectrum and is strikingly reproducible, but the initial small-effect mutations are soon outcompeted by rarer large-effect mutations that result in variability between replicates. These results suggest that early evolutionary dynamics may be deterministic for a period of time before stochastic effects become important.},

  review    = {RESULTS
-spectrum of fitness effects is neither exponential nor monotonic, but the spectrum at the lower end do lead to predicable dynamics that are reproducible
-For E1 beneficial mutaitons of small effects (2%<s<5%) dominate at the onset (t<72 gens), but are outcompeted by larger effect mutations (s>10%) later in both replicates (t>112 gens).  The dynamics of evolution in the latter time period are much more stochastic, because these mutations are rare and their establishment times have larger variances.
-For E2 beneficial mutaitons of small effects (2%<s<5%) where outcompeted by larger effect mutations (s>10%) much earlier, and by ~132 gens small effect mutations were a very minor fraction of the population total.
-other findings
-Double mutants are rare before 168 gens, so most of this experiment falls into the situation described by gerrish and lenksi 1998 framework in which the effect of multiple mutations is not relevant.  They estimate that possibly 0.2% of adaptive mutant lineages, 50 of their inferred estimates s and tau, are the result of double mutants.
-Also, for the time range that they examine, effects from ecology leading to frequency-dependent selection can be ignored.
-beneficial mutations observed were ~20,000 in E1 and ~11,000 in E2 for muations of low effect (2-5%), and 5,000 in E1 and 3,000 in E2 of large effect (~10%)      

ORGANISM (Saccharomyces cerevisiae):
-Eukaryotic fungus that can be haploid or diploid (preferential form), and reproduce in either state through mitosis 
-when under stress, diploids undergo meiosis and then sporulate to 4 haploid cells with exchanged genetic material.
-two mating types "a" and "alpha"
-cell size is roughly 5-10 micrometers
-1 gen = time to double ~ 100 minutes

COMMENTS
-we need to understand evolutionary dynamics to know which adaptive mutations are driving evolution and which are consequential.
-populations of cells are roughly 1e8 
-another important point is that their is potentially a beneficial mutation rate for each selectioin coefficient size, so we are really after an effective mutation rate as well as an effective selection coefficient.
-levy points out the barrier 1/Ub which is is about when multiple mutation effects kick for a lineage that has nearly fixed.
-section on beneficial mutation rates sites s>5% occur at rate ~1e-6 /cell/gen
-fluctuation test: refers to using luria and delbruck's work to estimate the mtuation rate
-ancestors have spontaneous mutation rate in non repeated regions ~4e-10
-the trajectories in fig 2a are most illustrative of the experiment in terms of what data was collected.  Every 8 gens the frequencies are measured and used to extrapolate their cell count as a function of time.  These are the red trajectories shown in the figure.
-section 11.1 in the supplement provides the way in which they inferred mutation rates for given selection coeff size, but there seem to be some typos and unclear steps in the derivation of formula 101.  Just move forward and maybe ask about it later.
-Its important to note that in section 11.1 they provide the units of the mesurements, i.e T = generations, s = 1/generations,
-breakdown of the predominant s deterministic approximation occurs for roughly s>0.08
-figure 41 (supp) gives a nice representation of the dynamics of s_dom in their analysis, and explains why it will have discontinuous behavior as a result of the shape of \mu(s)
-figure 43 (supp) gives a comparison of two methods to determine the beneficial mutation rate in relation to the size of the selection coefficient.
-the explanation for the estimates of the fraction of mutants in region 3, right before creating E1 and E2 replicate experiments is explained near formula (87)
-finding indicate that for t<72 gens, increases in mean fitness are being driven by small effect mutations 2%<s<5%, while at about 112 gens ~100 of the most beneficial mutations (s>10%) are driving most of the observed increases.

EXPERIMENT:
-figure 39 of supplement shows the preparation process leading up to the formation of the two replicate experiments
-generated yeast lineages by inserting a random 20 nucleotide barcode at a single location in their genome with landing pad in a neutral site (using plasmid library of ~5e5 barcodes)
-barcoding took 48 generations, in which adaptive mutations have occured to produce barcoded yeast library
-replicate experminents, labeled E1 and E2, using library were evolved for 168 gens with serial batch culture diluted 1:250 ever ~8 gens when the pop bottle neck was reached (~7e7 cells)
-during execution of replicate experiments frequencies of lineages were measured by isolating genomic DNA from pooled population (isolates used for dilution)
-supplement in 1.3 gives table with symbols and approximate measured values, Ne = 6e8, mean increase in fitness is 6% in E1 at t = 112

METHOD FOR ESTIMATING TAU AND S: 
1) develop a model for noise to account for the behavior of drift causing a lineage to fix, or measurement errors in sequencing
2) use model of noise and calculate probability that trajectory explained by mutation with fitness effect s having established time tau, over broad range of pairs (i.e. using prior distrib)
3) if above probability exceeds probability that no beneficial mutation occurs, define the trajectory as adaptive
4) estimates of s and tau for each adaptive lineage are combined to calculate a second measure of increase in mean fitness, which agrees with first and means that most beneficial mutations driving increases in mean fitness have been detected

  abstract  = {The fate of a newly arising beneficial mutation depends on many factors, such as the population size and the availability and fitness effects of other mutations that accumulate in the population. It has proved difficult to understand how these factors influence the trajectories of particular mutations, since experiments have primarily focused on characterizing successful clones emerging from a small number of evolving populations. Here, we present the results of a massively parallel experiment designed to measure the full spectrum of possible fates of new beneficial mutations in hundreds of experimental yeast populations, whether these mutations are ultimately successful or not. Using strains in which a particular class of beneficial mutation is detectable by fluorescence, we followed the trajectories of these beneficial mutations across 592 independent populations for 1000 generations. We find that the fitness advantage provided by individual mutations plays a surprisingly small role. Rather, underlying {\textquotedblleft}background{\textquotedblright} genetic variation is quickly generated in our initially clonal populations and plays a crucial role in determining the fate of each individual beneficial mutation in the evolving population.},

  abstract      = {Positive selection distorts the structure of genealogies and hence alters patterns of genetic variation within a population. Most analyses of these distortions focus on the signatures of hitchhiking due to hard or soft selective sweeps at a single genetic locus. However, in linked regions of rapidly adapting genomes, multiple beneficial mutations at different loci can segregate simultaneously within the population, an effect known as clonal interference. This leads to a subtle interplay between hitchhiking and interference effects, which leads to a unique signature of rapid adaptation on genetic variation both at the selected sites and at linked neutral loci. Here, we introduce an effective coalescent theory (a {\textquotedblleft}fitness-class coalescent{\textquotedblright}) that describes how positive selection at many perfectly linked sites alters the structure of genealogies. We use this theory to calculate several simple statistics describing genetic variation within a rapidly adapting population and to implement efficient backward-time coalescent simulations, which can be used to predict how clonal interference alters the expected patterns of molecular evolution.},

-develops coalescent theories (statistics) for the directional selection in asexual populations evolving in concurrent mutations regime

COMMENTS
-same model setup for concurrent mutations regime in desai and fisher 2007
-the U/s<<1 condition ensures that the stochastic nose rarely produces mutants of any sort, but there is still the question of the bulk and mutational pressures there.
-the examine patterns of genetic variation in a rapidly adapting population (clonal interf. regime) using a fitness class coalescent method
-derivation of equation 10 stems from the use of independence in the \nu_i for B loci indicated in the sum

COMMENTS FOR PAPER
-note that for their analysis of the genetic diversity, they focus strictly on the nose of the distribution, which means for your case, you will have to define what the nose is in this 2d distribution

The populations that retained the ancestral mutation rate support a model in which most fixed mutations are beneficial, the fraction of beneficial mutations declines as fitness rises, and neutral mutations accumulate at a constant rate. We also compared these populations to mutation-accumulation lines evolved under a bottlenecking regime that minimizes selection. Nonsynonymous mutations, intergenic mutations, insertions and deletions are overrepresented in the long-term populations, further supporting the inference that most mutations that reached high frequency were favoured by selection.

The tension between divergence and convergence has been a major focus of this experiment. I summarize analyses of competitive fitness, correlated responses to different environments, cell morphology, the capacity to use a previously untapped resource, mutation rates, genomic changes, and within-population polymorphisms. These analyses reveal convergence, divergence, and often a complicated mix thereof. Complications include concordance in the direction of evolutionary change with sustained quantitative variation among populations, and the potential for a given trait to exhibit divergence on one timescale and convergence on another. Despite these complications, which also occur in nature, experiments provide a powerful way to study evolutionary convergence based on analyzing replicate lineages that experience the same environment. },

The importance of these assumptions depends on the evolutionary scale of the questions we wish to ask. We discuss evolutionary interpretations of heritabilities and genetic correlations, emphasizing that the plasticity of quantitative-genetic parameters and the imprecision of their estimates are serious problems in the study of natural plant populations. It is important to separate the fundamental, long-term genetic constraints, which limit species evolution, from the transient genetic correlations that may be found in a particular population. It is unclear whether natural populations ever reach equilibrium conditions, in which the additive genetic variance for fitness is depleted. Under many circumstances it is difficult to deduce the past history of selection from the genetic architecture of metrical traits.},

Perhaps the greatest challenge in the analysis of pleiotropic genes is determining whether phenotypes associated with a mutation result from the loss of a single function or of multiple functions encoded by the same gene. Here we estimate the degree of pleiotropy in yeast by measuring the phenotypes of 4710 mutants under 21 environmental conditions, finding that it is significantly higher than predicted by chance. We use a biclustering algorithm to group pleiotropic genes by common phenotype profiles. Comparisons of these clusters to biological process classifications, synthetic lethal interactions, and protein complex data support the hypothesis that this method can be used to genetically define cellular functions. Applying these functional classifications to pleiotropic genes, we are able to dissect phenotypes into groups associated with specific gene functions.Mol Syst Biol. 1: 2005.0001},

We found that, under stabilizing selection, the variance of one character at equilibrium may depend on the strength of stabilizing selection on the other character (as in the house-of-cards model) or not (as in the multivariate normal model) depending on the types of mutations that can occur. Similarly, under directional selection, the genetic covariance between two characters may increase substantially (as in the house-of-cards model) or not (as in the multivariate normal model) depending on the kinds of mutations that are assumed to occur. Hence, even for the simple model we consider, neither the house-of-cards nor the multivariate normal model can be used to make predictions, making it unlikely that either could be used to draw general conclusions about more complex and realistic models.},

  abstract = {In quantitative genetics, there are two basic "conflicting" observations: abundant polygenic variation and strong stabilizing selection that should rapidly deplete that variation. This conflict, although having attracted much theoretical attention, still stands open. Two classes of model have been proposed: real stabilizing selection directly on the metric trait under study and apparent stabilizing selection caused solely by the deleterious pleiotropic side effects of mutations on fitness. Here these models are combined and the total stabilizing selection observed is assumed to derive simultaneously through these two different mechanisms. Mutations have effects on a metric trait and on fitness, and both effects vary continuously. The genetic variance (V(G)) and the observed strength of total stabilizing selection (V(s,t)) are analyzed with a rare-alleles model. Both kinds of selection reduce V(G) but their roles in depleting it are not independent: The magnitude of pleiotropic selection depends on real stabilizing selection and such dependence is subject to the shape of the distributions of mutational effects. The genetic variation maintained thus depends on the kurtosis as well as the variance of mutational effects: All else being equal, V(G) increases with increasing leptokurtosis of mutational effects on fitness, while for a given distribution of mutational effects on fitness, V(G) decreases with increasing leptokurtosis of mutational effects on the trait. The V(G) and V(s,t) are determined primarily by real stabilizing selection while pleiotropic effects, which can be large, have only a limited impact. This finding provides some promise that a high heritability can be explained under strong total stabilizing selection for what are regarded as typical values of mutation and selection parameters.},

Although pleiotropy is a common phenomenon with broad implications, its molecular basis is unclear.

However, the two groups of genes do not differ in the number of molecular functions or the number of protein domains per gene. Thus, pleiotropy is generally caused by a single molecular function involved in multiple biological processes.

most of us are interested in the relation between phenotype and selective advantage when applied to artificial selection in the population.  There are two different approaches, the mather school (birmingham) and lush school (edinburgh).

Mather, in his approach to quantitative genetics, was primarily interested in questions of gene action.  His theory, therefore, starts from a consideration of the effects of individual genes, and his experiments are set up with the intention of discovering things about the genes controlling quantitative variation.  For instance, how many genes are controlling differences between inbred lines?  To what extent can these differences be shown to be chromosomally inherited? To what extent are results affected by linkage?  The experimental designs were basically directed at gene action and linkage and have to be evaluated from this point of view.  In particular, I would stress that on the whole the experiments of the mather group do not consider a random breeding population to which the results will be applied.  In some cases, such an extrapolation to a random breeding population can easily be made, but in the main approach there has been no intention to do this.

The Lush school, on the other hand, has been primarily concerned with observations made on random breeding populations, with the descriptions of the relationships between different individuals in the population, and with the prediction of the response of the population to short-term changes in its environment, using this term in the widest sense.  This description is then given entirely in terms of variance compoenents, and it must not be forgotten that it is in essense a static description of the population.  It describes the population as it is at the moment, and cannot be expected to be an adequate description of the population as it will be after some generations of selection.  The problem of interpretation of these variance components, in terms of gene action, is an extremely difficult one, as we shall see later.  In any population the variance is presumably due to many genes.  We know neither the magnitude of the individual effects, the frequency of the alleles causing these effects, nor how the genes at different loci interact with one another.  The model cannot deal accurately with some situations, and we then have to discard the variance component model and go back to a description of the variance of the population in terms of the individual genes concerned.  The effect of inbreeding, for instance, can only be described under the very limiting assumption of completely additive gene action on the character concerned.  In predicting the effects of selection we can merely say that the instantaneous rate of selection will be proportional to the additive genetic variation at any instant of time, but we have no good methods of predicting the changes in the additive genetic variance itself.

A further consequence of the two approaches is that they have different residuary legatees.  By this I mean that they have different orders of preference for explanations of the response of the population to different changes in its situation.  For instance, the Mather school tends to prefer a description of experimental results in terms of linkage rather the pleiotropy.  On the other hand, the Lush school, on the whole, would prefer to explain surprising results in selection in terms of pleitropy and only invoke linkage as the very final resort.},

Over the past three decades, characterizing the genes underlying adaptive phenotypic change has revealed many important aspects of evolutionary change. At the same time, natural selection is often fundamentally an ecological process that can often be studied without identifying the genes underlying the variation on which it acts. This duality has given rise to disagreement about whether, and under what circumstances, it is necessary to identify specific genes associated with phenotypic change. This issue is of practical concern, especially for researchers who study nonmodel organisms, because of the often enormous cost and labor required to “go for the genes.” We here consider a number of situations and questions commonly addressed by researchers. Our conclusion is that although gene identification can be crucial for answering some questions, there are others for which definitive answers can be obtained without finding underlying genes. It should thus not be assumed that considerations of “empirical completeness” dictate that gene identification is always desirable.},

  abstract = {It could be argued that biometrical genetics is the foremost contribution of Birmingham to the world of learning in the present century. For this, the major credit goes to Professor Mather, and secondly to his principal collaborators, J. L. Jinks and B. J. Haynian. Biometrical Genetics was first published in 1949, with K. Mather as sole author [cf. XIX, p. 913]. It has undoubtedly been one of the most influential monographs of recent times. In the ensuing twenty years, extensive research into and extension of the ideas adumbrated in Mather's book have taken place, largely at Birmingham University, and the present second edition, of which Professor Jinks is now coauthor, though recognizably based on its predecessor, is so greatly enlarged as virtually to constitute a new work. It is the best guide to the research programme that Professor Mather has inspired. The present edition comprises twelve chapters. The first, on the genetical foundation, does not differ greatly from what went before; perhaps the mystique in which polygenes were originally enshrouded is now toned down. Chapter 2, on Characters, also follows the lines of the corresponding chapter in the earlier book. Chapter 3, however, is considerably changed and includes a description of recent work on the biometrical analysis of plasmatic variation. Scaling tests and scale transformation have been transferred to the next chapter, where they follow the treatment of additive and dominant components. It is difficult to avoid the impression that scale transformation is still the Achilles' heel of much of the elegant mathematical edifice which the authors present to us, especially when one finds, as is pointed out on p. 82, that a "scale which is satisfactory for fitting an additive-dominance model" may conflict with the "one which will normalize the distributions within the non-segregating generations". Chapter 5 has much new material and deals at length with nonallelic interaction, genotype x environment interaction and heterosis. In chapter 6, we pass on to the potentialities of 2nd degree statistics; this chapter reproduces much of the former chapter 4 on the partitioning of variance, with an interesting addition on weighted analysis. The chapter on linkage follows along the lines of the former chapter, but new examples are taken; in its final section the analysis of genotype x environment interaction proceeds one stage further. Chapter 8, in addition to treating randombreeding populations, formerly treated in chapter 4, also deals with the genetic study of twins, the genetics of experimental populations and the effect of partial inbreeding. Diallel analysis has been amongst the major preoccupation of the Birmingham School and is expounded at length in Chapter 9. Various special cases are treated in the next chapter, namely sex linkage, maternal effects, and the genetics of haploids and polyploids. The last two chapters follow the general lines of the final two chapters of the first edition. The first deals with the number of effective factors and the rate of advance under selection, both matters where the concordance between theory and practice has been unimpressive. The second, entitled Experiments and concepts, is able to review many carefully set up genetical experiments where the first edition was only able to refer to one as fully adequate, and even this one is not included in this chapter of the second edition. Opportunity is also taken here to attempt a rebuttal of some of the weightier criticims that current biometrical genetics has had to meet, notably by Gilbert [cf. XXXI, 2873], but hardly with sufficient force to disarm a persistent critic. The number of references in the bibliography has trebled in comparison with the former edition, and the current volume may be confidently recommended as definitive within its field.},

A bivariate pattern of selection acts to correlate the characters and, without pleiotropy, their genetic correlation is due entirely to linkage disequilibrium. Data on spontaneous mutation, the effective number of genes, and the intensity of natural selection on quantitative characters are used to evaluate the models. It is concluded that, even when selection favors a high correlation between the characters, with random mating and no linkage between loci influencing different traits the genetic correlation between characters is likely to be small in magnitude. A genetic correlation of large magnitude can be maintained only if the loci influencing different characters are tightly linked, or there is a high level of inbreeding in the population created by frequent mating between closely related individuals.},

-the relative importance of adaptive evolution, balancing selection, deletirous variation and genetic drift for phenotypic variation within and among populations remains unclear.
-discusses the progress that has been made so far in understanding the evolutionary processes that lead to phenotypic variation

Comments
-evolutionary biologist have sought to understand the evolutionary forces that influence genetic variation within and among natural populations
-theories for explaining segregating variation: mutation-selection balance (deletirious mutations), balancing selection
-Comparison between Drosophila species indicates that 40–95% of amino-acid replacements might reflect adaptive evolution
-However, the selection coefficients that influence most of these amino-acid changes are low (<1e–4), but adaptive substitutions occur at average of 10-50 years
-Test like "integrated extended haplotype homozygosity" can detect selection, but we still don't know if they can identify the key SNPs responsible for variation
-in populations that are hetergeneously distributed, models predict that low levels of gene flow will cause local adaptation
-def: "rank fitness": is the ordering by fitness of alleles in a particular environment.  NOTE: when rank fitness changes among alleles from one environment to the next, polymorphisms can be maintained

conclusion
-However, quantitative genetic and coarse QTL mapping studies are blind to the alleles that underlie complex trait variation. Only when we can recognize frequency and linkage-disequilibrium signatures of deleterious or advantageous polymorphisms as well as heterogeneousorigins of particular phenotypes, and determine allelic history as well as geography, can we infer which evolutionary processes influence the  nucleotide polymorphisms that control quantitative-trait variation 4,9,11,23.

  abstract      = {Trade-offs are a core component of many evolutionary models, particularly those dealing with the evolution of life histories. In the present paper, we identify four topics of key importance for studies of the evolutionary biology of trade-offs. First, we consider the underlying concept of ‘constraint’. We conclude that this term is typically used too vaguely and suggest that ‘constraint’ in the sense of a bias should be clearly distinguished from ‘constraint’ in the sense of proscribed combinations of traits or evolutionary trajectories. Secondly, we address the utility of the acquisition-allocation model (the ‘Y-model’). We find that, whereas this model and its derivatives have provided new insights, a misunderstanding of the pivotal equation has led to incorrect predictions and faulty tests. Thirdly, we ask how trade-offs are expected to evolve under directional selection. A quantitative genetic model predicts that, under weak or short-term selection, the intercept will change but the slope will remain constant. Two empirical tests support this prediction but these are based on comparisons of geographic populations: more direct tests will come from artificial selection experiments. Finally, we discuss what maintains variation in trade-offs noting that at present little attention has been given to this question. We distinguish between phenotypic and genetic variation and suggest that the latter is most in need of explanation. We suggest that four factors deserving investigation are mutation-selection balance, antagonistic pleiotropy, correlational selection and spatio-temporal variation, but as in the other areas of research on trade-offs, empirical generalizations are impeded by lack of data. Although this lack is discouraging, we suggest that it provides a rich ground for further study and the integration of many disciplines, including the emerging field of genomics.},

 Paper - Key Take Aways

-Main objective of the paper is to discuss how trade-offs evolve by reviewing four topics:
1) problems with the concept of constraint
2) insights from models of resource acquisition-allocation
3) the effect of directional selection on statistical description of trade-offs **
4) what maintains variation in the trade-off ***

PAPER RELAVANT COMMENTS
-Evolutionary biological thought firmly grounded on assumption that trait evolution is restricted or biased by fitness trade-offs (1)
-The existance of fitness trade-offs and their central place in shaping evolutionary trajectories is not doubted, but we lack an understanding (theor/empir) of how they evolve (3)
-Use of the word 'constraint' (effects of neg. genetic correlations) has two meanings, used in sense of: 1) impeding but not stopping evolution, 2) evolutionary trajectories unavailable to selection due to constraints
*Constraints in the sense of (2) require showing eval in some direction is zero, which is statistically hard (if not impossible) to show.
-Trade-offs are specified in QG by neg. covariance between traits, possibly caused by pleiotropy or LD 
-Problems such as "the problem of dimensionality" make it necessary to consider quantitative genetic analysis with phenotypic analysis focusing on underlying functional relationship.

-Section "expanding scope of Y-model" gives decomposition of variance between two traits as you derived in your model (read this section for additional conclusions)

These two observations are in direct conflict as such selection should deplete genetic variation. Furthermore, the presence of genetic variation in a trait, and selection acting on that trait, is often not sufficient for the trait to respond to selection. Here, we bring together geometric perspectives on mutation, selection, and genetic variation and show how the perceived incompatibility between these two observations is a consequence of taking a trait-by-trait approach to the multivariate problem of genetic variation and selection.

-fundamental contradicition at the heart of evolutionary biology: "genetic variation is maintained in natural populations in the presence of strong selection."
-goal of review: "establish the link between fundmental this fundamental contradiction and genetic limitations

READING NOTES
-two important observations that lead to scientific contradiction in evolutionary biology
1) widespread variance - substantial genetic variation maintained in natural populations in presence of strong selection
2) strong selection - life history traits which are under stronger selection,display more genetic variation than other types of traits (but even large Ve, hence lower heritability)

-trait by trait explanations for the coexistince of observation (1) and (2), in they show that these observations indicate that substantial multivariate genetic constraints in response to selection present in nature
-a geometrical view of genetic constraints inherent in Fisher's model, but a geometric view of genetic contraints emerges slowly until Dickerson 1955 points out deceptiveness of heritabilities and genetic constraints
-
Dickersons example shows that with special G (see paper) and selection in (1,1,1,1) direction combination of traits, there is no genetic variance despite there being genetic variance in each of the traits
-interesting observation: there are G matrices with only positive correlations that will have zero evals, and hence directions that cannot respond to selection
-study of two trait artificial selection experiment with selection response orthogonal to direction of strong genetic correlations, i.e genetic correlations are not effective contraints

-geometric interpretation of G gives reason why simple quantitative genetic measures of genetic variation and covariation have been unsuccessful in demonstrating genetic constraints
-eigenvalues of G are more informative than heritabilities or genetic correlations
-considerable interest in determining the statistical support of the genetic variance in an estimated G, and how many dimensions required to describe this subspace of significant genetic variation
-rank of P (phenotypic covariance matrix) sets an upper bound on the rang of G
-G-matrices are often ill conditioned (Kirkpatrick 2009), supports Barton's first conjecture, likely fewer genetically independent traits than phenotypes measured
-genetic correlation between male and female fitness may be negative due to evolution of sexual dimorphism (lande 1980, kirkpatrick 2009), so some fitness in both might be maintained by antagonistic pleiotropy
-widely applicable metric for measuring multivariate constraint comparable across studies is angle between $\beta$ and predicted response to selection $\Delta \bar{z}$, 0=no constraint, 90=abs. constraint
-robertson's secondary theorem of natural selection: the response in a trait equals its additive genetic covariance with fitness, $\Delta z = \sigma_A (z, w)$
-
in Lande and Arnolds regression approximation of fitness w = a + bz + zyz, the y terms give the local curvature of the fitness landscape, and y_ij !=0 suggests correlation selection
-Barton's conjectures (1990):
1) there is likely to be substanstially fewer genetically independent traits than measured phenotypes
2) only a few traits can be under strong stabilizing selection

Conclusions
1) depletion of genetic variation by strong selection maybe hidden in geometric complexities of multiple traits
2) trait combinations should display little genetic variation if strong selection present, but weak selection on other combinations can maintain larger variances
**) It be interesting if there is any differential geometry applications in the theory of fitness landscapes

COMMENTS FOR PAPER
-Fisher 1930 gives a model for adaptation with multiple traits to explain how in higher dimensional trait spaces
-Extensions to Fisher's model given by Kimura 1983 and Orr 1998, 2000
-Lande develops the multivariate breeder's equation (Lande's eqtn) in 1979 paper $\delta z = G \beta$
-**implications for how genetic constraints are manifested within G remain largely under appreciated, with more focus on estimation and interpretation
-Numerous experiments demonstrating genetic variance in almost any trait, can safely assume presence of genetic variance in any metric character
-**most genetic correlations are positive, but correlations among life history traits tend to be negative, more so than among physiological or morphological traits (Roff 1996)

We present an alternative analysis based on multilocus population genetics. We use a general representation of selection, recombination, and drift to analyze an idealized polygenic system in which all genetic effects are additive (i.e., both dominance and epistasis are absent), but no assumptions are made about the distribution of breeding values or the numbers of loci or alleles. Our analysis produces three results. First, our equations reproduce the standard recursions for the mean and additive variance if breeding values are Gaussian; but they also reveal how non-Gaussian distributions of breeding values will alter these dynamics. Second, an approximation valid for weak selection shows that even if genetic variance is attributable to an effectively infinite number of loci with only additive effects, selection will generally drive the distribution of breeding values away from a Gaussian distribution by creating multilocus linkage disequilibria. Long-term dynamics of means can depart substantially from the predictions of the standard selection recursions, but the discrepancy may often be negligible for short-term selection. Third, by including mutation, we show that, for realistic parameter values, linkage disequilibrium has little effect on the amount of additive variance maintained at an equilibrium between stabilizing selection and mutation. Each of these analytical results is supported by numerical calculations.},

  abstract = {Previous mathematical analyses of mutation-selection balance for metric traits assume that selection acts on the relevant loci only through the character(s) under study. Thus, they implicitly assume that all of the relevant mutation and selection parameters are estimable. A more realistic analysis must recognize that many of the pleiotropic effects of loci contributing variation to a given character are not known. To explore the consequences of these hidden effects, I analyze models of two pleiotropically connected polygenic traits, denoted P1 and P2. The actual equilibrium genetic variance for P1, based on complete knowledge of all mutation and selection parameters for both P1 and P2, can be compared to a prediction based solely on observations of P1. This extrapolation mimics empirically obtainable predictions because of the inevitability of unknown pleiotropic effects. The mutation parameters relevant to P1 are assumed to be known, but selection intensity is estimated from the within-generation reduction of phenotypic variance for P1. The extrapolated prediction is obtained by substituting these parameters into formulas based on single-character analyses. Approximate analytical and numerical results show that the level of agreement between these univariate extrapolations and the actual equilibrium variance depends critically on both the genetic model assumed and the relative magnitudes of the mutation and selection parameters. Unless per locus mutation rates are extremely high, i.e., generally greater than 10-4, the widely used gaussian approximation for genetic effects at individual loci is not applicable. Nevertheless, the gaussian approximations predict that the true and extrapolated equilibria are in reasonable agreement, i.e., within a factor of two, over a wide range of parameter values. In contrast, an alternative approximation that applies for moderate and low per locus mutation rates predicts that the extrapolation will generally overestimate the true equilibrium variance unless there is little selection associated with hidden effects. The tendency to overestimate is understandable because selection acts on all of the pleiotropic manifestations of a new mutation, but equilibrium covariances among the characters affected may not reveal all of this selection. This casts doubt on the proposal that much of the additive polygenic variance observed in natural populations can be explained by mutation-selection balance. It also indicates the difficulty of critically evaluating this hypothesis.},

  abstract  = {Do size and phylogeny affect patterns of covariation in life-history traits? If there are phylogenetic constraints on the evolution of life histories, do they differ from lineage to lineage? I applied principal component analysis and cluster analysis to two data sets - 65 mammal species (14 orders, 30 families, 10 traits) and 162 mammal species (22 orders, 64 families, 6 traits). In both data sets, most of the covariation in life-history traits could be accounted for by the first two factors, and in both data sets their interpretation was similar. The first factor, accounting for 68-75% of covariation of life-history traits, ranked the animals from early maturing, small, short-lived animals with short gestation periods, many small altricial young, and long lactation periods, to the opposite suite of traits in large animals. The second factor, accounting for 12-20% of the covariation in life-history traits, ranked the animals from altricial to precocial. When order and family effects were removed, the proportion of variance accounted for by the first factor dropped 29-36%, and the number of high-level clusters increased. Analysis within individual families revealed differences from lineage to lineage in the loadings of each trait on the first two principle factors. Weight alone accounts for much of the tendency for mammals to be arranged on a single axis ranging from early maturing, highly fecund, and short-lived small animals to the opposite. However, after the effects of weight were removed, order and family effects still had significant impact on patterns of covariation. Thus morphological design, in addition to size, may constrain life-history evolution. This explains why earlier workers saw clear patterns of covariation at high taxonomic levels whereas subsequent workers have found less covariation within species. /// &#x412;&#x43b;&#x438;&#x44f;&#x44e;&#x442;

  abstract      = {Quantitative genetics theory provides a framework that predicts the effects of selection on a phenotype consisting of a suite of complex traits. However, the ability of existing theory to reconstruct the history of selection or to predict the future trajectory of evolution depends upon the evolutionary dynamics of the genetic variance-covariance matrix (G-matrix). Thus, the central focus of the emerging field of comparative quantitative genetics is the evolution of the G-matrix. Existing analytical theory reveals little about the dynamics of G, because the problem is too complex to be mathematically tractable. As a first step toward a predictive theory of G-matrix evolution, our goal was to use stochastic computer models to investigate factors that might contribute to the stability of G over evolutionary time. We were concerned with the relatively simple case of two quantitative traits in a population experiencing stabilizing selection, pleiotropic mutation, and random genetic drift. Our results show that G-matrix stability is enhanced by strong correlational selection and large effective population size. In addition, the nature of mutations at pleiotropic loci can dramatically influence stability of G. In particular, when a mutation at a single locus simultaneously changes the value of the two traits (due to pleiotropy) and these effects are correlated, mutation can generate extreme stability of G. Thus, the central message of our study is that the empirical question regarding G-matrix stability is not necessarily a general question of whether G is stable across various taxonomic levels. Rather, we should expect the G-matrix to be extremely stable for some suites of characters and unstable for others over similar spans of evolutionary time.},

-find many life history traits are maintained well within the limits imposed by history and design, i.e. we don't get the extreme versions of traits that would result from selection (no citation)
-trade-offs have been measured through field observations, through experimental manipulations in laboratory and field, through phenotypic correlations in laboratory and through genetic correlations
-most prominent life history trade off involves cost of reproduction: williams - genetic costs from antagonistic pleiotropy and negative phenotypic costs represented by negative correlations
-distinction made between intragenerational trade offs and intraindividual trade offs
-at time of publication, no known way to use current genetic structure of population to infer tradeoffs that constrained past approach to current state
-trade-offs at phenotypic level: whole organism measurements on traits directly connected to reproduction and survival
-trade-offs at genotypic level: all types of evidence claimed to be genetic (QG, mendelian, molecular genetics)

-2 important cases to consider
(1) negative genetic correlations exists in a growing population, but most phenotypic variation is environmentally induced in traits, and so no trait correlations appear
(2) two phenotypic traits can be strongly negatively correlated, without any genetic basis, and selection pressure may exist but no evolutionary response is possible

-people have tried to measure genetic correlations with mixed results
(1) measurements made with breeding designs (full/half sib), have found positive, negative and insifnificant correlations (harder to deal with sampling problems addressed with family size)
(2) measurements of indirect selection on one trait correlated to another reveal mostly negative correlations (large number of these experiments more consistent)

-selection experiments are best suited to measure genetic correlations, but they need to be carried out in more environmental conditions to 
-clutch size vs other life histroy traits are often studied for trade offs
-hormones affect many processes simultaneously and create patterns of correlation among responses
-antagonistic pleiotropy in the evolution of senscence - female hormones promote reproduction in early life, but involve disturbances to calcium metabolism in later life
-endocrine system mediated genetic correlations need to be examined more in research
-example of positive correlation observed in measurements of individuals for allocation of energy between reproduction and survival
-life history theory predicts that life history traits should be negatively correlated (see olijnyk nelson for references)
-genetic covariance sensitive to changes in gene frequencies and substitution of genes, so caution must be taken when claiming that negative correlations have relavence to historical path leading to current state
-2 questions: what constrains evolution (trade-offs relevant), and what produced patterns we see today?
-3 important questions about relationship between 2 traits: (1) is it positive or negative? (2) what is its shape? (3) what are its interactions with other traits and environmental factors?

  abstract = {* A central tenet of life-history theory states that individuals are constrained from maximizing all aspects of fitness simultaneously through negative correlations among life-history traits, known as trade-offs. Although evidence for trade-offs is abundant, a surprising number of taxa reveal positive correlations where trade-offs are expected.

* Previous studies suggest two mechanisms to explain the lack of trade-offs in situations where they are predicted by theory: differential resource acquisition and multidimensional trait constraints expressed in the presence of genetic variation. However, there is no direct empirical evidence supporting either hypothesis.

* Using individuals from multiple genotypes of the cyclic parthenogenic freshwater zooplankton, Daphnia pulicaria, we conducted life-history experiments that prevented two key aspects of these mechanisms from operating. The experiments were conducted under a range of resources from levels causing near-starvation to levels of resource abundance yielding a mean clutch size of 4–5 eggs. Growth, reproduction and survival were measured for each individual.

* Contrary to expectations, we found strong positive correlations among life-history traits in the absence of both differential resource ingestion, which is one form of differential resource acquisition, and genetic variation. These positive correlations emerge from differential resource utilization, which is one of the steps along the resource ingestion-utilization-allocation pathway.

* Our results demonstrate that strong positive correlations among life-history traits emerge from variation among individuals in an underappreciated aspect of their energy budget. This alternative mechanism has different implications for understanding life-history evolution, and reinforces the potential role that physiological ecology has in shaping life-history trait correlations.},

-3 main empirical approaches used to investigate life history trade-offs: 1) measurement of phenotypics correlation in unmanipulated individuals, 2) genetic analysis, 3) experimental manipulations of phenotypes
-one school of thought is that genetically based covariation should be the focus of attention in trade-off studies since only genetically based traits can evolve
-Question: what is an example of a non genetic trade-off?
-Note: genetic approaches difficult to carryout,  limited in scope, in comparison to phenotypic studies
-wing polymorphism (flight capable morph vs non flight capable morph) is an exceptional experimental model for investigating physiological trade-off - early fecundity negatively associated with flight capability
-ex. Gryllus firmus increased ovarian growth in flightless morph 200-400%, reduction in flight muscles 40%, reduction in triglyceride reserves by 30%
-flight muscle growth does not appear to trade-off with ovarian growth (indicated by timing; 1st 2-3 days for latter) 

-D. melanogaster has been used to investigate trade-offs with genetic approaches
-short larval period correlated with reduced larval viability, diminished adult size and reduced fecundity (Nunney 1996, Chippindale et al. 1997).

Here I review what evolutionary and molecular biologists have learned about such "costs of reproduction" in the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) since Maynard Smith's (1958) seminal discovery that sterile mutants in D. subobscura live substantially longer than fertile wildtype flies. Together with observations from the nematode worm (Caenorhabditis elegans) and other organisms, the data from Drosophila suggest that there are at least four general principles that underlie trade-offs between reproduction and lifespan: (1) trade-offs between survival and reproduction are widespread; (2) the relationship between increased lifespan and decreased fecundity can be uncoupled under certain conditions; (3) while survival costs of reproduction might not necessarily be due to competitive resource allocation, we lack robust alternative explanations for their occurrence; and (4) physiological trade-offs between reproduction and longevity do not always translate into evolutionary genetic trade-offs. I conclude that - despite much recent progress - our current understanding of the proximate basis of survival costs of reproduction remains very limited; much future work on the genetics and physiology of such trade-offs will be required to uncover their mechanistic basis.},

There are four general factors which could play a role in causing this variation: mutation, elimination of deleterious variation, selection of favorable alleles, and balancing selection. Three factors could directly influence the mutational variability of traits: canalization, the mutational target size, and the timing of trait expression. Here I carry out simple tests of the importance of some of these factors using data from Drosophila melanogaster. I compiled information from the literature on the mutational and standing genetic variances in outbred populations, inferred the relative mutational target size of each trait, its a timing of expression, and used models of life history to calculate fitness sensitivities for each trait. Mutation variation seems to play an important role, as it is highly correlated with standing variance. The target size hypothesis was supported by a significant correlation between mutational variance and inferred target size. There was also a significant relationship between the timing of trait expression and mutational variance. These hypotheses are confounded by a correlation between timing and target size. The elimination and canalization hypotheses were not supported by these data, suggesting that they play a quantitatively less important role in determining overall variances. Additional information concerning the pleiotropic consequences of mutations would help to validate the fitness sensitivities used to test the elimination and canalization hypotheses.},

  abstract = {There are two distinct reasons for making comparisons of genetic variation for quantitative characters. The first is to compare evolvabilities, or ability to respond to selection, and the second is to make inferences about the forces that maintain genetic variability. Measures of variation that are standardized by the trait mean, such as the additive genetic coefficient of variation, are appropriate for both purposes. Variation has usually been compared as narrow sense heritabilities, but this is almost always an inappropriate comparative measure of evolvability and variability. Coefficients of variation were calculated from 842 estimates of trait means, variances and heritabilities in the literature. Traits closely related to fitness have higher additive genetic and nongenetic variability by the coefficient of variation criterion than characters under weak selection. This is the reverse of the accepted conclusion based on comparisons of heritability. The low heritability of fitness components is best explained by their high residual variation. The high additive genetic and residual variability of fitness traits might be explained by the great number of genetic and environmental events they are affected by, or by a lack of stabilizing selection to reduce their phenotypic variance. Over one-third of the quantitative genetics papers reviewed did not report trait means or variances. Researchers should always report these statistics, so that measures of variation appropriate to a variety of situations may be calculated.},

-concerned with evolvability and maintenance of variation in quantitative traits and comparing them using mean standardized measures
-really pushes the idea of using "relative evolvability of fitness" to compare evolvability of traits
-really pushes the idea of using "coefficients of variation" to compare variances of different quantitative genetic traits

COMMENTS
-life history traits have lower narrow sense heritabilities, but h^2 is not appropriate measure of evolvability
-appropriate measure of "relative evolvability of fitness" denoted I_A is given by  I_A = V_A / X_bar^2 = (CV_A / 100)^2
-I_A also appropriate indicator of the variability of fitness, as large values must be result of powerful forces maintaining genetic variance
-CV_A seems a reasonable dimensionless criterion for comparing genetic variabilities (used by Charlesworth 1984, 1987)
-some problems exist with CV_A; ex. high standardized phenotypic variability might suggest lack of strong stablizing selection
-fitness components posses V_A (see follow up entry)

-reviewed quantiative genetic studies of animal populations, specifically data sets that met 5 criteria
1) characters assumed to be under strong directional selection, or weak stabilizing selection
2) population studied may be assumed to be near genetic equilibrium
3) population studied was outbred
4) additive genetic variance was estimated using relatively unbiased methods
5) variances are reported in untransformed scale

DISCUSSION
-Fitness traits tend to integrate variability over the lifetime of the organism, hence likely that larger number of loci, wider range of environmental variables, and more interaction among them affect fitness traits than morphological ones
-under most models of the maintenance of genetic variance, genetic variance in trait will tend to be correlated with the number of loci which affect it
-difficult to obtain precise estimates of genetic variance for traits with low h^2;

This is usually interpreted in terms of Fisher's fundamental theorem to mean that populations are near evolutionary equilibrium and genetic variance in total fitness is low. We develop the causal relationship between metric traits and life-history traits to show that a life-history trait is expected to have a low heritability whether or not the population is at equilibrium. This is because it is subject to all the environmental variation in the metric traits that affect it plus additional environmental variation. There is no simple prediction regarding levels of additive genetic variance in life-history traits, which may be high at equilibrium. Several other patterns in the inheritance of life-history traits are readily predicted from the causal model. These include the strength of genetic correlations between life-history traits, levels of nonadditive genetic variance, and the inevitability of genotype-environment interaction.},

These findings are consistent with popular interpretations of Fisher's (1930, 1958) Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection, and Falconer (1960, 1981), but also indicate that high heritabilities are maintained within natural populations even for traits believed to be under strong selection.

In the hope of stimulating research in this area, I review empirical data from natural populations and draw the following conclusions. (1) Considerable additive genetic variance is present for most traits in most populations. (2) Trait correlations do not consistently oppose selection. (3) Adaptive differences between populations often involve dominance and epistasis. (4) Most adaptation is the result of genes of small-to-modest effect, although (5) some genes certainly have larger effects than the others. (6) Adaptation by independent lineages to similar environments is mostly driven by different alleles/genes. (7) Adaptation to new environments is mostly driven by standing genetic variation, although new mutations can be important in some instances. (8) Adaptation is driven by both structural and regulatory genetic variation, with recent studies emphasizing the latter. (9) The ecological effects of organisms, considered as extended phenotypes, are often heritable. Overall, the study of eco-evolutionary dynamics will benefit from perspectives and approaches that emphasize standing genetic variation in many genes of small-to-modest effect acting across multiple traits and that analyze overall adaptation or /`fitness/'. In addition, increasing attention should be paid to dominance, epistasis and regulatory variation.},

We use these data to make several qualitative tests of the mutation-selection balance hypothesis for the maintenance of genetic variance (MSB). To compare VM values, we use three dimensionless quantities: mutational heritability, the mutational coefficient of variation, CVM; and the ratio of the standing genetic variance to VM, VG/VM. Since genetic coefficients of variation for life history traits are larger than those for morphological traits, we predict that under MSB, life history traits should also have larger CVM. This is confirmed; life history traits have a median CVM value more than six times higher than that for morphological traits. VG/VM approximates the persistence time of mutations under MSB in an infinite population. In order for MSB to hold, VG/VM must be small, substantially less than 1000, and life history traits should have smaller values than morphological traits. VG/VM averages about 50 generations for life history traits and 100 generations for morphological traits. These observations are all consistent with the predictions of a mutation-selection balance model.},

  abstract      = {A fundamental question for both evolutionary biologists and breeders is the extent to which genetic correlations limit the ability of populations to respond to selection. Here I view this topic from three perspectives. First, I propose several nondimensional statistics to quantify the genetic variation present in a suite of traits and to describe the extent to which correlations limit their selection response. A review of five data sets suggests that the total variation differs substantially between populations. In all cases analyzed, however, the “effective number of dimensions” is less than two: more than half of the total genetic variation is explained by a single combination of traits. Second, I consider how patterns of variation affect the average evolutionary response to selection in a random direction. When genetic variation lies in a small number of dimensions but there are a large number of traits under selection, then the average selection response will be reduced substantially from its potential maximum. Third, I discuss how a low genetic correlation between male fitness and female fitness limits the ability of populations to adapt. Data from two recent studies of natural populations suggest this correlation can diminish or even erase any genetic benefit to mate choice. Together these results suggest that adaptation (in natural populations) and genetic improvement (in domesticated populations) may often be as much constrained by patterns of genetic correlation as by the overall amount of genetic variation.},

We assayed the ability of the Lenski Escherichia coli populations to grow on a range of carbon sources after 50,000 generations of adaptation on glucose. Using direct measurements of growth rates, we demonstrated that declines in performance were much less widespread than suggested by previous results from Biolog assays of cellular respiration. Surprisingly, there were many performance increases on a variety of substrates. In addition to the now famous example of citrate, we observed several other novel gains of function for organic acids that the ancestral strain only marginally utilized. Quantitative growth data also showed that strains with a higher mutation rate exhibited significantly more declines, suggesting that most metabolic erosion was driven by mutation accumulation and not by physiological tradeoffs. These reductions in growth by mutator strains were ameliorated by growth at lower temperature, consistent with the hypothesis that this metabolic erosion is largely caused by destabilizing mutations to the associated enzymes. We further hypothesized that reductions in growth rate would be greatest for substrates used most differently from glucose, and we used flux balance analysis to formulate this question quantitatively. To our surprise, we found no significant relationship between decreases in growth and dissimilarity to glucose metabolism. Taken as a whole, these data suggest that in a single resource environment, specialization does not mainly result as an inevitable consequence of adaptive tradeoffs, but rather due to the gradual accumulation of disabling mutations in unused portions of the genome.},

Performance trade-offs, such as those stemming from antagonistic pleiotropy, are thought to contribute to the maintenance of diversity in this scenario. Specifically, alleles that promote adaptation in one environment are expected to promote maladaptation in alternative environments. Contrary to this expectation, however, alleles that underlie locally adaptive traits often fail to exhibit fitness costs in alternative environments. Here, we attempt to explain this paradox by reviewing the results of experimental evolution studies, including a new one of our own, that examined the evolution of trade-offs during adaptation to homogeneous versus heterogeneous environments. We propose that when pleiotropic effects vary, whether or not trade-offs emerge among diverging populations will depend critically on ecology. For example, adaptation to a locally homogeneous environment is more likely to occur by alleles that are antagonistically pleiotropic than adaptation to a locally heterogeneous environment, simply because selection is blind to costs associated with environments that are not experienced locally. Our literature review confirmed the resulting prediction that performance trade-offs were more likely to evolve during selection in homogeneous than heterogeneous environments. The nature of the environmental heterogeneity (spatial versus temporal) and the length of the experiment also contributed in predictable ways to the likelihood that performance trade-offs evolved.},

  abstract      = {We review and discuss the importance of correlational selection (selection for optimal character combinations) in natural populations. If two or more traits subject to multivariate selection are heritable, correlational selection builds favourable genetic correlations through the formation of linkage disequilibrium at underlying loci governing the traits. However, linkage disequilibria built up by correlational selection are expected to decay rapidly (ie, within a few generations), unless correlational selection is strong and chronic. We argue that frequency-dependent biotic interactions that have 'Red Queen dynamics' (eg, host-parasite interactions, predator-prey relationships or intraspecific arms races) often fuel chronic correlational selection, which is strong enough to maintain adaptive genetic correlations of the kind we describe. We illustrate these processes and phenomena using empirical examples from various plant and animal systems, including our own recent work on the evolutionary dynamics of a heritable throat colour polymorphism in the side-blotched lizard Uta stansburiana. In particular, male and female colour morphs of side-blotched lizards cycle on five- and two-generation (year) timescales under the force of strong frequency-dependent selection. Each morph refines the other morph in a Red Queen dynamic. Strong correlational selection gradients among life history, immunological and morphological traits shape the genetic correlations of the side-blotched lizard polymorphism. We discuss the broader evolutionary consequences of the buildup of co-adapted trait complexes within species, such as the implications for speciation processes.},

Using approximate multivariate normal distribution methods, it is demonstrated that the condition for selection to result in a specialized phenotype is that the curve of fitness as a function of breeding value be bimodal. This implies that a specialized phenotype is more likely to result the higher is the heritability of the character.

However, this metaphor, with its emphasis on adaptive peaks and valleys, is to a large degree a reflection of our three-dimensional experience. Both genotypes and phenotypes of biological organisms differ in numerous characteristics, and, thus, the dimension of ‘real’ adaptive landscapes is much larger than three. Properties of multidimensional adaptive landscapes are very different from those of low dimension. Consequently, something that is seen as a theoretical challenge in a low-dimensional case might be a trivial problem in a multidimensional context and vice versa. In particular, the problem of how a population crosses an adaptive valley on its way from one adaptive peak to another, which Wright attempted to solve with his shifting balance theory, may be non-existent. A new framework is emerging for deepening our understanding of evolution and speciation, which provides a plausible multidimensional alternative to the conventional view of rugged adaptive landscapes.},

In many studies, there are significant changes in correlations and these can even switch sign across environments.

Here, I show why this approach is likely to misrepresent the genetic basis of quantitative traits, and the selection acting on them in many cases. Diagonalization of square matrices is a fundamental aspect of many of the multivariate statistical techniques used by biologists. Applying this, and other related approaches, to the analysis of the structure of γ and G matrices, gives greater insight into the form and strength of nonlinear selection, and the availability of genetic variance for multiple traits.},

The approach allows for arbitrary time-dependence of the selection coefficient s(t) and the population size N(t), as may result from an underlying ecological model. We derive compact analytical approximations for the fixation probability and the distribution of passage times for the beneficial allele to reach a given intermediate frequency. We apply the formalism to several biologically relevant scenarios, such as linear or cyclic changes in the selection coefficient, and logistic population growth. Comparison with computer simulations shows that the analytical results are accurate for a large parameter range, as long as selection is not very weak.},

We tested the hypothesis that parasitoids with different strategies select for alternative host defense characteristics and in doing so contribute to the maintenance of fitness variation and produce trade-offs among traits. We characterized defense traits of Drosophila when exposed to parasitoids with different host searching behaviors (Aphaereta sp. and Leptopilina boulardi). We used host larvae with different natural alleles of the gene Dopa decarboxylase (Ddc), a gene controlling the production of dopamine and known to influence the immune response against parasitoids. Previous population genetic analyses indicate that our focal alleles are maintained by balancing selection. Genotypes exhibited a trade-off between the immune response against Aphaereta sp. and the ability to avoid parasitism by L. boulardi. We also identified a trade-off between the ability to avoid parasitism by L. boulardi and larval competitive ability as indicated by differences in foraging and feeding behavior. Genotypes differed in dopamine levels potentially explaining variation in these traits. Our results highlight the potential role of parasitoid biodiversity on host fitness variation and implicate Ddc as an antagonistic pleiotropic locus influencing larval fitness traits.},

This change is due entirely to the correlation between pairs of loci which is induced by selection; the correlation is negative, leading to a reduction in the genetic variance under stabilizing or directional selection, and is positive, leading to an increase in the variance under disruptive selection. When selection ceases, the correlation rapidly disappears as joint equilibrium at pairs of loci is reestablished, and the variance returns to its original value. An expression is derived for the predicted amount of change in the genetic variance due to disequilibrium in the absence of linkage. The change is likely to be small under selection intensities found under natural conditions, but it may be appreciable under intense artificial selection. This limiting result shows that the magnitude of any permanent change in the variance due to selection must decrease as the number of loci involved increases and that, when the number of loci is large, it is likely to be much less than the temporary change due to disequilibrium.},

  review    = {NOTES:
Main topics of discussion are (i) reanalysis of Wilkinson’s 1990 large data set and addressing constancy of G matrices, (ii) discuss possible causes for statistically significant changes in G, and (iii) how such changes or lack thereof affect retrospective analysis.

Turelli 1988 emphasized that none of the models concerning heritable variation guarantee constancy of G and that this issue must be addressed empirically (see Barton Turelli 1989)

Wilkinson et al 1990 measured G constancy over 23 generations of divergent selection in drosophila.

Traits measured: Bristly number (BB), Thorax (TX), Wing Length (WL), Wing width (WW), tibia length (TB)

RESULTS: (1) as reported by Wilkinson there are statistically significant differences among the G matrices of their four populations, (2) although selection may have played a role in producing these differences, their magnitude and direction seem consistent with the effects of genetic drift, and (3) even when estimated G matrices are precisely constant, retrospective selection analyses may be misleading because of unobserved transient changes in G produced by periods of intense selection (the "Bulmer effect"; Bulmer 1980).

Wilkinson 1990 compared L(y_A,(G_A ) ̂ ) with L(y_A,(G_B ) ̂) (likelihoods of y_A given estimates (G_A ) ̂ and (G_B ) ̂, which is wrong because it ignores sampling variation in (G_B ) ̂.  Here L(y_A,G ̂) is the likelihood of the data y_A given G ̂.
	
The comparisons revealed highly significant differences in G between the Base population and the population selected for small thorax ("Small") and also between the Base and Control populations (tables 1, 2).  The G matrices of the populations selected for large and small thorax were also significantly different. In contrast, the G matrix of Large did not differ significantly (P > 0.15) from those of either the Base or Control populations, nor did the G matrix of Small differ significantly from that of Control.
	
DRIFT EXPLANATION: The small size of the selected and Control populations makes genetic drift a plausible alternative. This is apparently supported by the highly statistically significant difference between the G matrices of the Base and Control populations.  From basic drift calculation, the expect a 23% reduction in additive variance from drift. The qualitative conclusion is that although selection may well have altered the G matrices, the observed reduction in variances seem compatible with expectations from genetic drift alone.
	
BULMER EFFECT: are selection induced changes in G, will confound the effects and results from retrospective selection analysis.  They use a two trait simple model to compare the retrospective selection β_retro, with actual selection β_T after accounting for the Bulmer effect using eqtn (5).},

  abstract      = {We develop a general population genetic framework for analyzing selection on many loci, and apply it to strong truncation and disruptive selection on an additive polygenic trait. We first present statistical methods for analyzing the infinitesimal model, in which offspring breeding values are normally distributed around the mean of the parents, with fixed variance. These show that the usual assumption of a Gaussian distribution of breeding values in the population gives remarkably accurate predictions for the mean and the variance, even when disruptive selection generates substantial deviations from normality. We then set out a general genetic analysis of selection and recombination. The population is represented by multilocus cumulants describing the distribution of haploid genotypes, and selection is described by the relation between mean fitness and these cumulants. We provide exact recursions in terms of generating functions for the effects of selection on non-central moments. The effects of recombination are simply calculated as a weighted sum over all the permutations produced by meiosis. Finally, the new cumulants that describe the next generation are computed from the non-central moments. Although this scheme is applied here in detail only to selection on an additive trait, it is quite general. For arbitrary epistasis and linkage, we describe a consistent infinitesimal limit in which the short-term selection response is dominated by infinitesimal allele frequency changes and linkage disequilibria. Numerical multilocus results show that the standard Gaussian approximation gives accurate predictions for the dynamics of the mean and genetic variance in this limit. Even with intense truncation selection, linkage disequilibria of order three and higher never cause much deviation from normality. Thus, the empirical deviations frequently found between predicted and observed responses to artificial selection are not caused by linkage-disequilibrium-induced departures from normality. Disruptive selection can generate substantial four-way disequilibria, and hence kurtosis; but even then, the Gaussian assumption predicts the variance accurately. In contrast to the apparent simplicity of the infinitesimal limit, data suggest that changes in genetic variance after 10 or more generations of selection are likely to be dominated by allele frequency dynamics that depend on genetic details.},

This result is here extended to allow for the effect of linkage, and it is shown that the change in the variance is effectively determined by the harmonic mean of the recombination fractions. The validity of the approximate general formula derived here has been checked by comparison with exact results obtained from models with five or six loci. In order to determine the likely value of the harmonic mean recombination fraction, a simple model was constructed in which it was assumed that loci are distributed at random along the chromosome maps.

However, little is known about the evolution of G and about its long-term importance in constraining phenotypic evolution. We first investigated the degree of conservation of the G matrix across three species of crickets and qualitatively compared the pattern of variation of G to the phylogeny of the group. Second, we investigated the effect of G on phenotypic evolution by comparing the direction of greatest quantitative genetic variation within species (gmax) to the direction of phenotypic divergence between species (?z?). Each species, Gryllus veletis, G. firmus, and G. pennsylvanicus, was reared in the laboratory using a full-sib breeding design to extract quantitative genetic information. Five morphological traits related to size were measured. G matrices were compared using three statistical approaches: the T method, the Flury hierarchy, and the MANOVA method. Results revealed that the differences between matrices were small and mostly caused by differences in the magnitude of the genetic variation, not by differences in principal component structure. This suggested that the G matrix structure of this group of species was preserved, despite significant phenotypic divergence across species. The small observed differences in G matrices across species were qualitatively consistent with genetic distances, whereas ecological information did not provide a good prediction of G matrix variation. The comparison of gmax and ?z? revealed that the angle between these two vectors was small in two of three species comparisons, whereas the larger angle corresponding to the third species comparison was caused in large part by one of the five traits. This suggests that multivariate phenotypic divergence occurred mostly in a direction predicted by the direction of greatest genetic variation, although it was not possible to demonstrate the causal relationship from G to ?z?. Overall, this study provided some support for the validity of the predictive power of quantitative genetics over evolutionary time scales.

Each species, Gryllus veletis, G. firmus, and G. pennsylvanicus, was reared in the laboratory using a full-sib breeding design to extract quantitative genetic information. Five morphological traits related to size were measured. G matrices were compared using three statistical approaches: the T method, the Flury hierarchy, and the MANOVA method. Results revealed that the differences between matrices were small and mostly caused by differences in the magnitude of the genetic variation, not by differences in principal component structure. This suggested that the G matrix structure of this group of species was preserved, despite significant phenotypic divergence across species. The small observed differences in G matrices across species were qualitatively consistent with genetic distances, whereas ecological information did not provide a good prediction of G matrix variation. The comparison of gmax and ?z? revealed that the angle between these two vectors was small in two of three species comparisons, whereas the larger angle corresponding to the third species comparison was caused in large part by one of the five traits. This suggests that multivariate phenotypic divergence occurred mostly in a direction predicted by the direction of greatest genetic variation, although it was not possible to demonstrate the causal relationship from G to ?z?. Overall, this study provided some support for the validity of the predictive power of quantitative genetics over evolutionary time scales.},

  abstract      = {An absence of genetic variance in traits under selection is perhaps the oldest explanation for a limit to evolutionary change, but has also been the most easily dismissed. We review a range of theoretical and empirical results covering single traits to more complex multivariate systems, and show that an absence of genetic variance may be more common than is currently appreciated. From a single-trait perspective, we highlight that it is becoming clear that some trait types do not display significant levels of genetic variation, and we raise the possibility that species with restricted ranges may differ qualitatively from more widespread species in levels of genetic variance in ecologically important traits. A common misconception in many life-history studies is that a lack of genetic variance in single traits, and genetic constraints as a consequence of bivariate genetic correlations, are different causes of selection limits. We detail how interpretations of bivariate patterns are unlikely to demonstrate genetic limits to selection in many cases. We advocate a multivariate definition of genetic constraints that emphasizes the presence (or otherwise) of genetic variance in the multivariate direction of selection. For multitrait systems, recent results using longer term studies of organisms, in which more is understood concerning what traits may be under selection, have indicated that selection may exhaust genetic variance, resulting in a limit to the selection response.},

  abstract      = {Quantitative genetics provides a powerful framework for studying phenotypic evolution and the evolution of adaptive genetic variation. Central to the approach is G, the matrix of additive genetic variances and covariances. G summarizes the genetic basis of the traits and can be used to predict the phenotypic response to multivariate selection or to drift. Recent analytical and computational advances have improved both the power and the accessibility of the necessary multivariate statistics. It is now possible to study the relationships between G and other evolutionary parameters, such as those describing the mutational input, the shape and orientation of the adaptive landscape, and the phenotypic divergence among populations. At the same time, we are moving towards a greater understanding of how the genetic variation summarized by G evolves. Computer simulations of the evolution of G, innovations in matrix comparison methods, and rapid development of powerful molecular genetic tools have all opened the way for dissecting the interaction between allelic variation and evolutionary process. Here I discuss some current uses of G, problems with the application of these approaches, and identify avenues for future research.},

  abstract      = {The time-scale for the evolution of additive genetic variance-covariance matrices (G-matrices) is a crucial issue in evolutionary biology. If the evolution of G-matrices is slow enough, we can use standard multivariate equations to model drift and selection response on evolutionary time scales. We compared the G-matrices for meristic traits in two populations of gaiter snakes (Thamnophis elegans) with an apparent separation time of 2 million years. Despite considerable divergence in the meristic traits, foraging habits, and diet, these populations show conservation of structure in their G-matrices. Using Flury's hierarchial approach to matrix comparisons, we found that the populations have retained the principal components (eigenvectors) of their G-matrices, but their eigenvalues have diverged. In contrast, we were unable to reject the hypothesis of equal environmental matrices (E-matrices) for these populations. We propose that a conserved pattern of multivariate stabilizing selection may have contributed to conservation of G- and E-matrix structure during the divergence of these populations.},

  abstract      = {The comparison of additive genetic variance-covariance matrices (G-matrices) is an increasingly popular exercise in evolutionary biology because the evolution of the G-matrix is central to the issue of persistence of genetic constraints and to the use of dynamic models in an evolutionary time frame. The comparison of G-matrices is a nontrivial statistical problem because family structure induces nonindependence among the elements in each matrix. Past solutions to the problem of G-matrix comparison have dealt with this problem, with varying success, but have tested a single null hypothesis (matrix equality or matrix dissimilarity). Because matrices can differ in many ways, several hypotheses are of interest in matrix comparisons. Flury (1988) has provided an approach to matrix comparison in which a variety of hypotheses are tested, including the two extreme hypotheses prevalent in the evolutionary literature. The hypotheses are arranged in a hierarchy and involve comparisons of both the principal components (eigenvectors) and eigenvalues of the matrix. We adapt Flury's hierarchy of tests to the problem of comparing G-matrices by using randomization testing to account for nonindependence induced by family structure. Software has been developed for carrying out this analysis for both genetic and phenotypic data. The method is illustrated with a garter snake test case.},

  abstract      = {The evolution of quantitative characters can be described by the equation Δz¯=GP−1S where Δz¯ is the vector of mean responses, G is the matrix of additive genetic variances and covariances, P is the matrix of phenotypic variances and covariances and S is the vector of selection differentials. This equation can be used to predict changes in trait values or to retrospectively estimate the selection gradient and is thus a central equation of evolutionary quantitative genetics. Genetic variances and covariances will be reduced by stabilizing selection, directional selection and drift, and increased by mutation. Changes in trait values resulting from directional selection that are comparable with differences observed among species are readily obtainable in short geological time spans (<5000 generations) with selection intensities so small that they would have an insignificant effect on the G matrix (of course it is possible that such changes came about by strong selection over a few generations, followed by long periods of stasis; there is insufficient evidence to presently distinguish these two possibilities). On the other hand, observed effective population sizes are sufficiently small that considerable changes in G can be expected from drift alone. The action of drift can be distinguished from selection because the former produces a proportional change in G whereas the latter, in general, will not. A survey of studies examining variation in G suggests that the null hypothesis that most of the variation can be attributed to drift rather than selection cannot be rejected. However, more research on the predicted statistical distribution of G as a result of selection and/or drift is required and further development of statistical tests to distinguish these two forces needs to be made.},
